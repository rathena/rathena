//=====eAthena Script====================================
// Wedding Script
//=====By================================================
// AppleGirl and Evera(version 1.0)
//=====Current Version===================================
// 1.45b
//=====Compatible With:==================================
// Any eAthena Version; RO Episode 6+
//=====Description=======================================
// Fully working wedding script for all kind of weddings
//=====Additional Comments:==============================
// Tested and debugged by whocares (maybe 1-2 bugs left)(version 1.1)
//======= Version 1.2 By ShadowLady =====================
// Same Sex Weddings.
// Now the script(npcs) tell the players how they must perform exactly.
//======= Version 1.3 By ShadowLady =====================
// You might need to update the wedding rings in item_db
// Same for the tux/dress, so all classes and lvs can use it ^^
// And check if they are wearing the tux/dress and not only have it on the inventory.
//======= Version 1.4 By ShadowLady =====================
// Added some code ideas. Thanks to Jbain for help me debbuging
// Added @outfit variable, to check if you already bought a tux/dress
// Fixed "part" of the divorce npc. The code is bugged by itself -_- Need both chars to be online yet.
////======= Version 1.45 By ShadowLady =====================
// Fixed some minor bugs. Same-sex is disabled by default now.
// Change $progress variable to $@progress, so it dont screw up the ceremony on a server crash.
// Added a Special GM Menu to enable/disable same-sex weddings and reset most variables.
////======= Version 1.45b By Aria =====================
// Added the $progress to $@progress variable change that ShadowLady put in notes, but not in code.
//=======================================================
// Variable Notes:
//
// event_wedding - 1 signifies marriage
// $groom$ - Groom's name storage
// $bride$ - Bride's name storage
// $@progress - Sets global restriction upon wedding
// @register - Temporary registration check
// @zleft - Temporary zeny needed check
// $name$ - Insert name for bride
// $name2$ - Insert name for groom
// $get_ring - Check so you can't get ring twice
// $reason$ - Objection to wedding
// @outfit - Check if the char already got a dress or tuxedo from the npc
// Tristan
