The "Mobs" folder contains the official spawns
The "eA Mobs" folder is modified for eAthena in an attempt to have more balanced/fair spawns.

This is a list of what files are modified, and what are not, just so you don't have to go searching all the files for that info.
The [Modified] tag tells that the file is changed, compared to the official spawn.
The [Approved] tag tells that the file in not modified, but has been approved as being balanced/fair.
The [Not Approved] tag  tells that the file in not modified and has not yet been approved.
