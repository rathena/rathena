// Bonus to loot priority for first attacker (Note 2)
// The first player in the damage log of a monster that is alive and on the same map gains a loot priority bonus
// Officially 30% of the total damage to a monster is added to this player's damage when calculating loot priority
// If you set this to 0, then loot priority will be solely calculated based on most damage dealt
// If you set this to 100 (max), then the first player in the damage log will always get first loot priority
// Loot priority determines how early a player can loot an item (see settings below)

// Use logarithmic drops? (Note 1)
// Logarithmic drops scale drop rates in a non-linear fashion using the equation 
// Droprate(x,y) = x * (5 - log(x)) ^ (ln(y) / ln(5))
// Where x is the original drop rate and y is the drop_rate modifier (the previously mentioned item_rate* variables)
// Use the following table for an idea of how the rate will affect drop rates when logarithmic drops are used:
// Y: Original Drop Rate
// X: Rate drop modifier (eg: item_rate_equip)
//  X\Y | 0.01 0.02  0.05  0.10  0.20  0.50  1.00  2.00  5.00 10.00 20.00

// Can the monster's drop rate become 0? (Note 1)
// Default: no (as in official servers).
drop_rate0item: no

// Increase item drop rate +0.01%? (Note 1)

mercenary_autoloot: no

// Is getting items from a mercenary disabled when their master's idle?
// Set to no, or the amount of seconds (NOT milliseconds) that need to pass before considering
// a character idle.
// Characters in a chat/vending are always considered idle.
// A character's idle status is reset upon item use/skill use/attack (auto attack counts too)/movement.
// Their master will only receive items if 'mercenary_autoloot' is activated,
// otherwise they will be dropped on the ground as usual.
// NOTE: This option uses a special timer to track idle time, separated from the normal idle timer.

// NOTE: This allows you to configure different settings for mercenary, separated from normal idle timer and 'idletime_option'.
// It will only apply to mercenary-only kills and it will not affect normal autoloot and party share options.
