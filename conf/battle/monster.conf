// The HP rate of MVPs. (Note 2)
mvp_hp_rate: 100

// The HP rate of normal monsters (that is monsters that are not MVP's) (Note 2)
monster_hp_rate: 100

// Defines various mob AI related settings. (Note 3)
// 0x0001: When enabled, mobs will update their target cell every x cells moved.
//         (normally they never update their target cell until they are one cell
//         before the end of their walkpath. x = monster_chase_refresh, see below)
// 0x0002: Makes mob use their "rude attack" skill (usually warping away) if they
//         are attacked and they can't attack back regardless of how they were
//         attacked (eg: GrimTooth), otherwise, their "rude attack" is only activated
//         if they can't melee reach the target (eg: sniping)
// 0x0004: If not set, mobs that can change target only do so when attacked within a
//         distance of [attack range+1], otherwise mobs may change target and chase 
//         ranged attackers. This flag also overrides the 'provoke' target.
// 0x0008: When set, mobs scatter as soon as they lose their target. Use this mode
//         to make it much harder to mob-train by hiding and collecting them on a
//         single spot (ie: GrimTooth training)
// 0x0010: If set, mob skills defined for friends will also trigger on themselves.
// 0x0020: When set, the monster ai is executed for all monsters in maps that 
//         have players on them, instead of only for mobs who are in the vicinity
//         of players.
// 0x0040: When set, when the mob's target changes map or is out of sight, the mob
//         will walk towards npc-warps and/or priest warps in its sight of view.
//         It will only walk to warps it can use and only to warps that bring it back
//         in sight of the target (use with mob_warp below).
// 0x0080: If not set, mobs on attack state will only change targets when attacked
//         by normal attacks. Set this if you want mobs to also switch targets when
//         hit by skills.
// 0x0100: When set, a mob will pick a random skill from it's list and start from
//         that instead of checking skills in orders (when unset, if a mob has too
//         many skills, the ones near the end will rarely get selected)
// 0x0200: When set, a mob's skill re-use delay will not be applied to all entries of
//         the same skill, instead, only to that particular entry (eg: Mob has heal
//         on six lines in the mob_skill_db, only the entry that is actually used
//         will receive the delay). This will make monsters harder, especially MvPs.
// 0x0400: Set this to make mobs have a range of 9 for all skills. Otherwise, they 
//         will obey the normal skill range rules.
// 0x0800: When set, monsters that are provoked will always change target to the
//         provoking person, even if they would usually not change target on attack.
// 0x1000: When set, when a monster picks a skill but can't use it because there is
//         no valid target in range, it will look for another skill it can use.
//         This makes e.g. Greatest General use "Earth Spike" at range 8-9 whereas
//         officially it would only use it after already having used "Blind Attack"
//         at range 0-7.
// 0x2000: When set, monsters will move right after they attacked or used a skill.
//         Usually a monster's AI is inactive for its attack motion.
// Example: 0x140 -> Chase players through warps + use skills in random order.
monster_ai: 0

// How often should a monster rethink its chase?
// 0: Every 100ms (MIN_MOBTHINKTIME)
// 1: Every cell moved
// x: Every x cells moved or one cell before the end of the chase path
// 32 (max): One cell before the end of the chase path (official)
// Regardless of this setting, a monster will always check for targets in attack range.
// Decrease this value if you want to make monsters be more reactive while chasing.
// If you want monsters to update their target cell while chasing you also need to enable
// monster_ai 0x0001, see above. Otherwise this only defines the maximum amount of cells
// monsters will move after they lost their target (hide, no line of sight, etc.).
monster_chase_refresh: 32

// Should mobs be able to be warped (add as needed)?
// 0: Disable.
// 1: Enable mob-warping when standing on NPC-warps

// 8: Enable mob-warping when standing on Dimensional Door
mob_warp: 0

// Defines the time (in ms) during which monsters will have their AI active

chase_range_rate: 100

// Which level of of Vulture's Eye and Snake's Eye should monsters have learned?
// Officially monsters don't have these skills learned, so their ranged skills

boss_spawn_delay: 100

// Should the mobs respawn time have variance applied to it? (Note 3)

// 3: All monsters (legacy Athena)
mob_spawn_variance: 1

// Should mobs not spawn within the viewing range of players?

// NOTE: This has no effect on mobs that always spawn on the very same cell
// (like ant eggs) except if you set it to the max.
no_spawn_on_player: 0

// Should spawn coordinates in the mob-spawn files be ignored? (Note 1)
// If set to yes, all monsters will have a random respawn spot across the whole
// map regardless of what the mob-spawn file says.
force_random_spawn: no

// Should each monster's center cell be randomized? (Note 1)
// Officially, at server start, each monster's center cell is set to a random cell in the spawn area.
// Each time the monster spawns it will spawn in an area around its center cell rather than the
// original center of the spawn definition. This results in a much larger total spawn area and a
// different experience each server start.
// Set this to "no" if you want all monsters of a spawn to spawn around the original center of the
// spawn definition, making the total spawn area much smaller (old eAthena behavior).
randomize_center_cell: yes

// Do summon slaves inherit the passive/aggressive traits of their master?

slave_active_with_master: no

// Will summoned monsters (alchemists, or @summon'ed monsters) attack cause a
// chance of triggering the master's autospell cards? (Note 1)
summons_trigger_autospells: yes

// When a mob is attacked by another monster, will the mob retaliate against the master of said mob instead of the mob itself?
// NOTE: Summoned mobs are both those acquired via @summon and summoned by Alchemists
retaliate_to_master: yes

// Whether mobs should change target temporarily when a skill triggers a counter mob skill (Note 1)
// eg: Mob attacks player B, and player A casts a skill C. If set to yes and the
// mob has a skill that is triggered by skill C, then A will be the target of
// the skill, otherwise B will be targetted by the reaction skill.

// This is only invoked under the 'monster' command, @monsterbig, and @monstersmall. (Note 1)
// Default: no
mob_size_influence: no

// How should a monster be trapped by an icewall casted directly on it?
// On official servers, monsters can only leave an icewall to the west and south. If their target is north or east of
// them they will continously try to chase it but fail doing so. This brings them into a loop during which they will use
// idle and chase skills. Boss monsters on the other hand will behave like a trapped monster, do not move and will use
// idle and rudeattacked skills (when attacked).
// 0: Monster won't be stuck in icewall at all.
// 1: Monster will behave like a trapped monster.
// 2-255: Number of loops a monster will go through the behavior described above before it frees itself from icewall.
// NOTE: On some servers, normal monsters can free themselves after 15-35 second depending on their speed. On other
// servers, they will be stuck inside icewall until it expires. Also, many official servers (e.g. iRO) have casting
// icewall completely blocked on all maps that have boss monsters on them.
// Default (least exploitable): mob - 75, boss - 0
// Default (most official): mob - 220, boss - 1

// exploits and be notified about them, you can set this to yes.
monster_stuck_warning: no

// Rate at which monsters use their idle skills when there are no players nearby (Note 2)
// On official servers monsters use their idle skills if they have been spotted once, even if there are no players nearby anymore.
// On small-medium sized servers this can cause all monsters like eggs and Fabre/Pupa to metamorph.
// To switch it off, set it to 0.
mob_nopc_idleskill_rate: 100
