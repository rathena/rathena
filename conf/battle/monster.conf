// The HP rate of MVPs. (Note 2)
mvp_hp_rate: 100

// The HP rate of normal monsters (that is monsters that are not MVP's) (Note 2)
monster_hp_rate: 100

// The maximum attack speed of a monster
monster_max_aspd: 199

// Defines various mob AI related settings. (Note 3)
// 0x001: When enabled mobs will update their target cell every few iterations
//        (normally they never update their target cell until they reach it while
//        chasing)
// 0x002: Makes mob use their "rude attack" skill (usually warping away) if they
//        are attacked and they can't attack back regardless of how they were
//        attacked (eg: GrimTooth), otherwise, their rude attack" is only activated
//        if they can't melee reach the target (eg: sniping)
// 0x004: If not set, mobs that can change target only do so when attacked within a
//        distance of [attack range+1], otherwise mobs may change target and chase 
//        ranged attackers. This flag also overrides the 'provoke' target.
// 0x008: When set, mobs scatter as soon as they lose their target. Use this mode
//        to make it much harder to mob-train by hiding and collecting them on a
//        single spot (ie: GrimTooth training)
// 0x010: If set, mob skills defined for friends will also trigger on themselves.
// 0x020: When set, the monster ai is executed for all monsters in maps that 
//        have players on them, instead of only for mobs who are in the vicinity
//        of players.
// 0x040: When set, when the mob's target changes map, the mob will walk towards
//        any npc-warps in it's sight of view (use with mob_warp below)
// 0x080: If not set, mobs on attack state will only change targets when attacked
//        by normal attacks. Set this if you want mobs to also switch targets when
//        hit by skills.
// 0x100: When set, a mob will pick a random skill from it's list and start from
//        that instead of checking skills in orders (when unset, if a mob has too
//        many skills, the ones near the end will rarely get selected)
// 0x200: When set, a mob's skill re-use delay will not be applied to all entries of
//        the same skill, instead, only to that particular entry (eg: Mob has heal
//        on six lines in the mob_skill_db, only the entry that is actually used
//        will receive the delay). This will make monsters harder, especially MvPs.
// 0x400: Set this to make mobs have a range of 9 for all skills. Otherwise, they 
//        will obey the normal skill range rules.
// 0x800: When set, monsters that are provoked will always change target to the
//        provoking person, even if they would usually not change target on attack.
// Example: 0x140 -> Chase players through warps + use skills in random order.
monster_ai: 0

// How often should a monster rethink its chase?
// 0: Every 100ms (MIN_MOBTHINKTIME)
// 1: Every cell moved
// 2: Every 2 cells moved
// 3: Every 3 cells moved (official)
// x: Every x cells moved
// Regardless of this setting, a monster will always rethink its chase if it has 
// reached its target. Increase this value if you want to make monsters continue
// moving after they lost their target (hide, no line of sight, etc.).
monster_chase_refresh: 3

// Should mobs be able to be warped (add as needed)?
// 0: Disable.
// 1: Enable mob-warping when standing on NPC-warps

// (as long as the target is outside their field of view). This is the range3
// column in the mob_db. (Note 2)
chase_range_rate: 100

// Which level of of Vulture's Eye and Snake's Eye should monsters have learned?
// Officially monsters don't have these skills learned, so their ranged skills

// be increased by that number.

// Allow monsters to be aggresive and attack first? (Note 1)

boss_spawn_delay: 100

// Should the mobs respawn time have variance applied to it? (Note 3)
// On official servers monsters spawned by the boss_monster command (mostly MVPs) have variance, legacy Athena behavior is that variance is applied for all mobs.
// 0: None
// 1: Boss monsters (official)
// 2: Normal monsters
// 3: All monsters (legacy Athena)
mob_spawn_variance: 1

// Should mobs not spawn within the viewing range of players?
// 0 is disabled, otherwise it is the number of retries before giving up 
// and spawning the mob within player-view anyway, unless the max (100) is used,
// in which case the mob will not be spawned, and it'll be retried again in

// Will summoned monsters (alchemists, or @summon'ed monsters) attack cause a

// Whether mobs should change target temporarily when a skill triggers a counter mob skill (Note 1)

// NOTE: This affects who gains the Castle when the Emperium is broken. 
mob_npc_event_type: 1

// Default: no
mob_size_influence: no

// How should a monster be trapped by an icewall casted directly on it?
// On official servers, monsters can only leave an icewall to the west and south. If their target is north or east of
// them they will continously try to chase it but fail doing so. This brings them into a loop during which they will use
// idle and chase skills. Boss monsters on the other hand will behave like a trapped monster, do not move and will use
// idle and rudeattacked skills (when attacked).
// 0: Monster won't be stuck in icewall at all.
// 1: Monster will behave like a trapped monster.
// 2-255: Number of loops a monster will go through the behavior described above before it frees itself from icewall.
// NOTE: On some servers, normal monsters can free themselves after 15-35 second depending on their speed. On other
// servers, they will be stuck inside icewall until it expires. Also, many official servers (e.g. iRO) have casting
// icewall completely blocked on all maps that have boss monsters on them.
// Default (least exploitable): mob - 75, boss - 0
// Default (most official): mob - 220, boss - 1

// Should a monster respawn and a warning printed to the map server when a monster couldn't move for a long time?
// This can be legit gameplay (e.g. players keeping an MVP stuck inside icewall), but if you want to prevent any
// exploits and be notified about them, you can set this to yes.
monster_stuck_warning: no

// Rate at which monsters use their idle skills when there are no players nearby (Note 2)
// On official servers monsters use their idle skills if they have been spotted once, even if there are no players nearby anymore.
// On small-medium sized servers this can cause all monsters like eggs and Fabre/Pupa to metamorph.
// To switch it off, set it to 0.
mob_nopc_idleskill_rate: 100
boss_nopc_idleskill_rate: 100
