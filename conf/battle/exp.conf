// Note 1: Value is a config switch (on/off, yes/no or 1/0)
// Note 2: Value is in percents (100 means 100%)
// Note 3: The max level of classes is stored in the exp table.
//         See files db/exp.txt and db/exp2.txt to change them.

// Rate at which exp. is given. (Note 2)
base_exp_rate: 100

// Rate at which job exp. is given. (Note 2)
job_exp_rate: 100

// Turn this on to allow a player to level up more than once from a kill. (Note 1)
multi_level_up: no

// Allow multi level up until a certain level?
// This only triggers if multi_level_up is enabled.
// Default: 0 (Unlimited)
multi_level_up_base: 0
multi_level_up_job: 0

// Setting this can cap the max experience one can get per kill specified as a
// % of the current exp bar. (Every 10 = 1.0%)
// For example, set it to 500 and no matter how much exp the mob gives, 
// it can never give you above half of your current exp bar.
max_exp_gain_rate: 0

// Method of calculating earned experience when defeating a monster:
// 0 = uses damage given / total damage as damage ratio
// 1 = uses damage given / max_hp as damage ratio
// NOTE: Using type 1 disables the bonus where the first attacker gets 
//       his share of the exp doubled when multiple people attack the mob.
exp_calc_type: 0

// Experience increase per attacker. That is, every additional attacker to the
// monster makes it give this much more experience
// (eg: 5 people attack with 25 here, +(25*4)% -> +100% exp)
exp_bonus_attacker: 25

// Max number of attackers at which exp bonus is capped
// (eg: if set at 5, the max bonus is 4*bonus-per-char regardless of attackers)
exp_bonus_max_attacker: 12

// MVP bonus exp rate. (Note 2)
mvp_exp_rate: 100

// Rate of base/job exp given by NPCs. (Note 2)
quest_exp_rate: 100

// The rate of job exp. from using Heal skill (100 is the same as the heal amount, 200 is double.
// The balance of the exp. rate is best used with 5 to 10)
heal_exp: 0

// The rate of exp. that is gained by the process of resurrection, a unit is 0.01%.
// Experience calculations for the experience value * level difference of the person revived / 100 * resurrection_exp/10000 which the revived player has can be got.
resurrection_exp: 0

// The rate of job exp. when using discount and overcharge on an NPC
// (in 0.01% increments - 100 is 1%, 10000 is normal, 20000 is double.)
// The way it is calculated is (money received * skill lv) * shop_exp / 10000.
shop_exp: 0

// PVP exp.  Do players get exp in PvP maps
// (Note: NOT exp from players, but from normal leveling)
pvp_exp: yes

// When a player dies, how should we penalize them?
// 0 = No penalty.
// 1 = Lose % of current level when killed.
// 2 = Lose % of total experience when killed.
death_penalty_type: 1

// Base exp. penalty rate (Each 100 is 1% of their exp)
death_penalty_base: 100

// Job exp. penalty rate (Each 100 is 1% of their exp)
death_penalty_job: 100

// When a player dies (to another player), how much zeny should we penalize them with?
// NOTE: It is a percentage of their zeny, so 100 = 1%
zeny_penalty: 0

// Will players on max base/job level lose the EXP on death?
// 0: Never lose (default as in official).
// 1: Lose Base EXP.
// 2: Lose Job EXP.

// Will display experience gained from killing a monster. (Note 1)
disp_experience: no

// Will display zeny earned (from mobs, trades, etc) (Note 1)
disp_zeny: no

// Use the contents of db/statpoint.txt when doing a stats reset and leveling up? (Note 1)
// If no, an equation will be used which preserves statpoints earned/lost 
// through external means (ie: stat point buyers/sellers)
use_statpoint_table: yes

// Use the contents of db/traitpoint.txt when doing a stats reset and leveling up? (Note 1)
// If no, an equation will be used which preserves trait points earned/lost 
// through external means (ie: trait point buyers/sellers)
use_traitpoint_table: yes

// EXP cost for cast PR_REDEMPTIO (Note 2)
exp_cost_redemptio: 1

// How many player needed to makes PR_REDEMPTIO's EXP penalty become 0?
// If by default, the 'exp_cost_redemptio' is 1 (1%) and every single player revived the penalty is reduced to 0.2%,
// it means 'exp_cost_redemptio_limit' is 5.
exp_cost_redemptio_limit: 5
