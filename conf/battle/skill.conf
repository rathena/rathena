// Does the delay time depend on the caster's DEX and/or AGI? (Note 1)
// Note: On Official servers, neither Dex nor Agi affect delay time
delay_dependon_dex: no
delay_dependon_agi: no

// Minimum allowed delay for ANY skills after castbegin (in milliseconds) (Note 1)
// Note: Setting this to anything above 0 can stop speedhacks.
min_skill_delay_limit: 100

// This delay is the min 'can't walk delay' of all skills.
// NOTE: Do not set this too low, if a character starts moving too soon after 
// doing a skill, the client will not update this, and the player will appear
// to "teleport" afterwards. Monsters use AttackMotion instead.
default_walk_delay: 300

// Completely disable skill delay of the following types (Note 3)
// NOTE: By default mobs don't have the skill delay as specified in the skill
//  database, but follow their own 'reuse' skill delay which is specified on
//  the mob skill db. When set, the delay for all skills become
//  min_skill_delay_limit.

// At what dex does the cast time become zero (instacast)?
castrate_dex_scale: 150

// How much (dex*2+int) does variable cast turns zero?
vcast_stat_scale: 530

// On official servers, amotion delay is applied at castbegin. There is no amotion delay applied
// at castend. Set this to anything above 0 to also apply amotion delay at castend. (Note 2)
// NOTE: Setting this will break chaining of skills with cast time but no aftercast delay.
// The client-sided delays are different from skill to skill and usually range from 140 to 180.
// If you want to be secure, a value between 90 and 140 is recommended.
skill_amotion_leniency: 0

// Will normal attacks be able to ignore the delay after skills? (Note 1)
skill_delay_attack_enable: yes

// Range added to skills after their cast time finishes.

// Does the distance between caster and target define if the skill is a ranged skill? (Note 3)
// If set, when the distance between caster and target is greater than 3 the skill is considered long-range, otherwise it's a melee range.
// If not set, then the range is determined by the skill's range (if it is above 5, the skill is ranged).
// Default 14 (mobs + pets + homun)
skillrange_by_distance: 14

// Should the equipped weapon's range override the skill's range defined in the skill_db for most weapon-based skills? (Note 3)
// NOTE: Skills affected by this option are those whose range in the skill_db are negative. By default always the skill range is used.

//See db/(pre-)re/skill_db.yml for more info.
defunit_not_enemy: no

// Should skills always do at least 'hits' damage when they don't miss/are blocked?
// Many skills will have their damage multiplied by their number of hits (see skill_db), these will always deal 1 HP
// damage per hit, even against plants. But some skills are actually a single hit that is just displayed as multiple
// hits. For these skills, damage gets divided by number of hits and rounded down. That means that plants won't take
// any damage from them. Examples: Sonic Blow, Lord of Vermillion
// With this setting, you can change the official behavior and make these skills deal at least 1 HP damage per hit.

// On official servers, Storm Gust consists of 81 units that all deal 3x3 splash damage "away from center". Due to
