// Does the delay time depend on the caster's DEX and/or AGI? (Note 1)
// Note: On Official servers, neither Dex nor Agi affect delay time
delay_dependon_dex: no
delay_dependon_agi: no

// Minimum allowed delay for ANY skills after casting (in milliseconds) (Note 1)
// Note: Setting this to anything above 0 can stop speedhacks.
min_skill_delay_limit: 100

// This delay is the min 'can't walk delay' of all skills.
// NOTE: Do not set this too low, if a character starts moving too soon after 
// doing a skill, the client will not update this, and the player/mob will 
// appear to "teleport" afterwards.
default_walk_delay: 300

//Completely disable skill delay of the following types (Note 3)
//NOTE: By default mobs don't have the skill delay as specified in the skill
//  database, but follow their own 'reuse' skill delay which is specified on
//  the mob skill db. When set, the delay for all skills become
//  min_skill_delay_limit.

//
// NOTE: Setting this to 100% may cause some issues with valid skills not being cast.
//       The time difference between client and server varies so allowing 90% leniency
//       should be enough to forgive very small margins of error.

// Should the equipped weapon's range override the skill's range defined in the skill_db for most weapon-based skills? (Note 3)
