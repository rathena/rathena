// The rate of time it takes to cast a spell (Note 2, 0 = No casting time)
casting_rate: 100

// Delay time after casting (Note 2)
delay_rate: 100

// Does the delay time depend on the caster's DEX and/or AGI? (Note 1)
// Note: On Official servers, neither Dex nor Agi affect delay time
delay_dependon_dex: no
delay_dependon_agi: no

// Minimum allowed delay for ANY skills after castbegin (in milliseconds) (Note 1)
// Note: Setting this to anything above 0 can stop speedhacks.
min_skill_delay_limit: 100

// Should attack motion be applied as minimum skill delay at castbegin? (Note 1)
// The client usually doesn't send skill commands faster than attack motion.
// However, there are a few tricks to make the client send commands faster.
// For some unit types like mercenaries and homunculus, there is no adequate
// server-sided delay in some situations, so it's possible to use skills faster
// than attack motion using these tricks.
// Set this to "yes" if you want to prevent these tricks and ensure that the
// delay between using skills at castbegin is at least attack motion.
amotion_min_skill_delay: no

// This delay is the min 'can't walk delay' of all skills.
// NOTE: Do not set this too low, if a character starts moving too soon after 
// doing a skill, the client will not update this, and the player will appear
// to "teleport" afterwards. Monsters use AttackMotion instead.
default_walk_delay: 300

// Completely disable skill delay of the following types (Note 3)
// NOTE: By default mobs don't have the skill delay as specified in the skill
//  database, but follow their own 'reuse' skill delay which is specified on
//  the mob skill db. When set, the delay for all skills become
//  min_skill_delay_limit.
no_skill_delay: 2

// At what dex does the cast time become zero (instacast)?
castrate_dex_scale: 150

// How much (dex*2+int) does variable cast turns zero?
vcast_stat_scale: 530

// On official servers, amotion delay is applied at castbegin. There is no amotion delay applied
// at castend. Set this to anything above 0 to also apply amotion delay at castend. (Note 2)
// NOTE: Setting this will break chaining of skills with cast time but no aftercast delay.
// The client-sided delays are different from skill to skill and usually range from 140 to 180.
// If you want to be secure, a value between 90 and 140 is recommended.
skill_amotion_leniency: 0

// Will normal attacks be able to ignore the delay after skills? (Note 1)
skill_delay_attack_enable: yes

// Range added to skills after their cast time finishes.
// Decides how far away the target can walk away after the skill began casting before the skill fails.
// 0 disables this range checking (default)

// If the target moves out of range while casting, do we take the items and SP for the skill anyway? (Note 1)
skill_out_range_consume: no

// Does the distance between caster and target define if the skill is a ranged skill? (Note 3)
// If set, when the distance between caster and target is greater than 3 the skill is considered long-range, otherwise it's a melee range.
// If not set, then the range is determined by the skill's range (if it is above 5, the skill is ranged).
// Default 14 (mobs + pets + homun)
skillrange_by_distance: 14

// Should the equipped weapon's range override the skill's range defined in the skill_db for most weapon-based skills? (Note 3)
// NOTE: Skills affected by this option are those whose range in the skill_db are negative. By default always the skill range is used.
// Note that if you want all monster skills to have a range of 9 you need to set monster_ai&0x400.
skillrange_from_weapon: 0

// Should a check on the caster's status be performed in all skill attacks?
// When set to yes, meteors, storm gust and any other ground skills will have 
// no effect while the caster is unable to fight (eg: stunned).
skill_caster_check: yes

// Should ground placed skills be removed as soon as the caster dies? (Note 3)
clear_skills_on_death: 0

// Should ground placed skills be removed when the caster changes maps? (Note 3)
clear_skills_on_warp: 15

//Setting this to YES will override the target mode of ground-based skills with the flag 0x01 to "No Enemies"
//The two skills affected by default are Pneuma and Safety Wall (if set to yes, those two skills will not protect everyone, but only allies)
//See db/(pre-)re/skill_db.yml for more info.
defunit_not_enemy: no

// Should skills always do at least 'hits' damage when they don't miss/are blocked?
// Many skills will have their damage multiplied by their number of hits (see skill_db), these will always deal 1 HP
// damage per hit, even against plants. But some skills are actually a single hit that is just displayed as multiple
// hits. For these skills, damage gets divided by number of hits and rounded down. That means that plants won't take
// any damage from them. Examples: Sonic Blow, Lord of Vermillion
// With this setting, you can change the official behavior and make these skills deal at least 1 HP damage per hit.
