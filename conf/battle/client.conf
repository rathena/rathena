// Made in to plainer English by Ancyker
//--------------------------------------------------------------
// Note 1: Value is a config switch (on/off, yes/no or 1/0)
// Note 2: Value is in percents (100 means 100%)
// Note 3: Value is a bit field. If no description is given,
//         assume unit types (1: Pc, 2: Mob, 4: Pet, 8: Homun, 16: Mercenary)
//--------------------------------------------------------------

// When set to yes, the damage field in packets sent from woe maps will be set
// to -1, making it impossible for GMs, Bots and Hexed clients to know the
// actual damage caused by attacks. (Note 1)
hide_woe_damage: no

// "hair style" number that identifies pet.
// NOTE: The client uses the "hair style" field in the mob packet to tell them apart from mobs.
// This value is always higher than the max hair-style available in said client.
// Known values to work (all 2005 clients):
// older sakexes: 20
// sakexe 0614: 24

// NOTE: Default is 99. Values above 127 will probably behave incorrectly.
// NOTE: If you don't know what this does, don't change it!!!
max_lv: 99

// Level required to display an aura.
// NOTE: This assumes that sending max_lv to the client will display the aura.
// NOTE: aura_lv must not be less than max_lv.
// Example: If max_lv is 99 and aura_lv is 150, characters with level 99~149
//          will be sent as being all level 98, and only characters with level
//          150 or more will be reported as having level 99 and show an aura.
aura_lv: 99

// Units types affected by max_lv and aura_lv settings. (Note 3)
// Note: If an unit type, which normally does not show an aura, is
//       set it will obtain an aura when it meets the level requirement.
// Default: 0 (none)

// NOTE: Set to 'no' will make client won't update enemy position unless the players have "Intravision" effect.

//       But it will screw 'the game animation display' while players in invisible state.
