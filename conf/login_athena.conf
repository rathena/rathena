// Whatever text is commented will not be parsed by the servers, and serves
// only as information/reference.

// The login server listens on the interface with this IP address.
// NOTE: This allows you to run multiple servers on multiple interfaces
// while using the same ports for each server.
//bind_ip: 127.0.0.1
 
// Login Server Port
login_port: 6900

//Time-stamp format which will be printed before all messages.
//Can at most be 20 characters long.
//Common formats:
// %I:%M:%S %p (hour:minute:second 12 hour, AM/PM format)

// %d/%b/%Y (day/Month/year)
//For full format information, consult the strftime() manual.

//16: Hide Error and SQL Error messages.
//32: Hide Debug Messages
//Example: "console_silent: 7" Hides information, status and notice messages (1+2+4)

// To log the login server?

log_login: yes

//When set to yes, the login server will refuse connections from accounts that are considered online already. 
//When a login attempt is rejected, the account in question is also kicked from all connected char-servers.
//It's safe to turn this off if there's only one char-server connected, or if the char-servers don't share 
//the same backend (ie: Multiple char servers reading from the same SQL tables)
online_check: yes

// Indicate how to display date in logs, to players, etc.
