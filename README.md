## Motivation

This project was born from a frustration with arbitrary moderation practices in the rAthena community. After being banned from the rAthena Discord server without solid justification—simply because a staff member decided they didn't like me—I realized the importance of creating an independent, community-driven alternative.

<div align="center">
  <img src="doc/rathena staff power abuse.png" width="700" alt="Evidence of rAthena staff power abuse - arbitrary ban without justification" />
  <br>
  <em><strong>Evidence of arbitrary moderation:</strong> Banned from rAthena Discord without solid justification</em>
</div>

<br>

**This fork represents:**
- **Freedom from arbitrary authority**: No single person should have unchecked power to silence contributors
- **Technical innovation**: Pushing rAthena beyond its traditional boundaries with cutting-edge AI integration
- **Community empowerment**: Building a space where ideas and code matter more than personal preferences
- **Open collaboration**: Welcoming all developers regardless of past conflicts with other communities

If you've ever felt silenced, dismissed, or unfairly treated by those in positions of power, this project is for you. Let's build something better together.

## Overview

rAthena AI World is an enhanced fork of rAthena MMORPG server that integrates multi-agent AI systems for autonomous NPC behavior, dynamic quest generation, and emergent gameplay. The system implements personality-driven NPCs using the Big Five personality model, AI-generated dialogue with long-term memory, and real-time economic simulation.

### 🎯 Core Concept

This project transforms Ragnarok Online from static scripted gameplay to an **AI-driven autonomous world** where:

- 🧠 **NPCs possess genuine consciousness** using the Big Five personality model and moral alignments
- 🎭 **NPCs make independent decisions** and form dynamic relationships with players and each other
- 🌊 **Player actions have lasting consequences** with ripple effects across the game world
- 📜 **Dynamic quest generation** based on world state, NPC personalities, and player history
- 🏛️ **Emergent society and behavior** rather than scripted events - the world evolves organically

### Core Features

- **Personality-Driven NPCs**: Each NPC exhibits unique behavior based on the Big Five personality model (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) and nine moral alignments
- **AI-Generated Dialogue**: Adaptive conversations using LLM providers with persistent memory across sessions
- **Social Intelligence**: Trust-based information sharing where NPCs decide what to reveal based on relationship level
- **Dynamic Quest System**: AI-generated quests with eight quest types, six difficulty levels, and eleven trigger mechanisms, contextually tailored to player state and world events
- **Economic Simulation**: Supply and demand mechanics with four economic agent types, production chains, and emergent market behaviors
- **Faction System**: Dynamic reputation systems with seven faction types and eight reputation tiers affecting all NPC interactions
- **Autonomous World State**: NPCs make independent decisions and react to world events, creating emergent storylines
- **21 Specialized AI Agents**: Six agent categories handling dialogue, decisions, memory, world events, quests, economy, and more

## Hybrid P2P/Multi-CPU Architecture

### Overview

The rAthena AI World project implements a **hybrid Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and multi-CPU architecture** that enables a single-shard, globally unified MMO world with low-latency gameplay, massive scalability, and cost efficiency.

⚠️ **P2P Coordinator:** Framework code exists but requires completion for production use. Single-server deployment fully functional.

### Key Features

- **Single World, Multi-Region:** All players share one authoritative world state, with edge regions for low-latency access.
- **Hybrid Networking:** P2P mesh for non-critical updates (e.g., movement, visuals), with authoritative server validation for critical game logic.
- **Multi-CPU Scaling:** Regional worker pools leverage multi-core CPUs for high concurrency and simulation throughput.
- **Protocol Specialization:** QUIC for real-time and P2P, gRPC/TCP for transactions, NATS JetStream for cross-region event streaming.
- **Automatic Fallback:** P2P is fully optional—when disabled or unavailable, the system seamlessly reverts to traditional server routing with no gameplay impact.
- **Legacy Compatibility:** Fully compatible with legacy deployments; P2P can be enabled or disabled per zone or globally via configuration.
- **Observability:** Comprehensive monitoring, tracing, and logging via Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Loki/Elasticsearch.
- **Resilience:** Automatic failover, ownership migration, and disaster recovery for both worker and region-level failures.

### Implementation Status

- Core architecture designed and documented in [`P2P-multi-CPU.md`](P2P-multi-CPU.md)
- Framework code implemented but requires additional work for production P2P coordination
- Single-server deployment fully functional without P2P
- **Seamless fallback** to traditional routing fully supported

### Configuration & Documentation

- **Enabling/Disabling P2P:** See [P2P Coordinator Configuration Guide](src/p2p-coordinator/README.md) and [WARP P2P Client README](../WARP-p2p-client/README.md).
- **Tuning Multi-CPU/Worker Pools:** Refer to [Architecture Documentation](P2P-multi-CPU.md#part-5-cpu-scaling-performance--resource-management) and [Deployment Guides](UBUNTU_SERVER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Metrics, logs, and traces are described in [P2P-multi-CPU.md#part-6-monitoring-observability--devops](P2P-multi-CPU.md#part-6-monitoring-observability--devops) and [Prometheus/Grafana setup](ai-autonomous-world/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Legacy/Compatibility Notes:** P2P is a performance enhancement, not a requirement. The system operates identically for all players when P2P is disabled.

**For a complete technical deep dive, see [`P2P-multi-CPU.md`](P2P-multi-CPU.md) and the [Final Verification Report](FINAL_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md).**

### 🆕 NPC Social Intelligence & Information Sharing System

**Status**: ⚠️ Experimental (Beta Quality)

NPCs now intelligently decide what information to share with players based on trust, relationship level, and personality traits, creating more realistic and dynamic social interactions.

#### Information Sensitivity Levels

NPCs categorize information into four sensitivity levels, each requiring different relationship thresholds:

- **PUBLIC** (Threshold: 0) - General information available to anyone
- **PRIVATE** (Threshold: 5) - Personal information shared with acquaintances
- **SECRET** (Threshold: 8) - Sensitive information shared only with trusted friends
- **CONFIDENTIAL** (Threshold: 10) - Highly sensitive information shared only with closest allies

#### Personality-Based Sharing Modifiers

NPC personality traits dynamically adjust information sharing thresholds:

- **High Agreeableness** (>0.7): -1 threshold modifier (shares more easily, friendly and open)
- **Low Agreeableness** (<0.3): +1 threshold modifier (shares less easily, guarded and suspicious)
- **High Neuroticism** (>0.7): +1 threshold modifier (more cautious, anxious about sharing)
- **Low Neuroticism** (<0.3): -1 threshold modifier (less cautious, confident in sharing)
- **High Openness** (>0.7): -1 threshold modifier (more willing to share, curious and expressive)

**Example**: An NPC with high agreeableness (0.8), low neuroticism (0.2), and high openness (0.95) would have a -3 total adjustment, making them very open to sharing information even with players they've just met.

#### Relationship-Based Information Filtering

- NPCs evaluate player relationship level before sharing information
- Information is filtered in real-time during dialogue generation
- Players must build trust over time to access more sensitive information
- Different NPCs with different personalities share information at different rates

#### Information Sharing History

- All information sharing events are stored in OpenMemory SDK
- Tracks what specific information has been shared with each player
- Prevents repetitive information sharing
- Enables NPCs to reference past shared information in future conversations

#### Example Behavior

**Lyra the Explorer** (Friendly, Open Personality):
- Agreeableness: 0.80, Neuroticism: 0.20, Openness: 0.95
- Threshold Adjustment: -3 (very open to sharing)
- At relationship level 0: Shares PUBLIC information
- At relationship level 6: Shares PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and most SECRET information
- Response style: Warm, engaging, hints at deeper secrets

**Guard Thorne** (Cautious, Guarded Personality):
- Agreeableness: 0.25, Neuroticism: 0.85, Openness: 0.20
- Threshold Adjustment: +2 (very restrictive)
- At relationship level 0: Shares nothing (even PUBLIC requires relationship 2)
- At relationship level 1: Still shares nothing
- Response style: Professional, guarded, emphasizes discretion

### 🆕 Configurable NPC Movement Boundaries

**Status**: ⚠️ Experimental (Beta Quality)

NPCs can now be configured with different movement restrictions, allowing for more realistic and controlled autonomous behavior.

#### Movement Modes

- **Global** - NPCs can move freely across all maps without restrictions
- **Map-Restricted** - NPCs stay within their current map, cannot cross map boundaries
- **Radius-Restricted** - NPCs stay within a defined tile radius from their spawn point
- **Disabled** - NPCs remain stationary at their spawn location

#### Per-NPC Configuration

Each NPC can be individually configured with:
- **Movement Mode**: One of the four modes above
- **Movement Radius**: Tile radius for radius-restricted mode (0-100 tiles)
- **Spawn Point**: Reference point for radius calculations (map, x, y coordinates)

#### Boundary Validation

- All movement decisions are validated before execution
- NPCs attempting to move outside boundaries are blocked
- Detailed logging of boundary violations for debugging
- Graceful fallback to idle behavior when no valid movement position exists

#### DecisionAgent Integration

- Movement decisions respect configured boundaries
- Wander and exploration behaviors stay within allowed areas
- Automatic radius adjustment based on current distance from spawn
- Maximum 10 attempts to find valid position before falling back to idle

#### Example Configurations

**Guard Thorne** (Patrol Guard):
- Movement Mode: `radius_restricted`
- Movement Radius: `7 tiles`
- Spawn Point: `prontera (145, 175)`
- Behavior: Patrols a small area around the guard post

**Lyra the Explorer** (Stationary NPC):
- Movement Mode: `disabled`
- Movement Radius: `0 tiles`
- Spawn Point: `prontera (155, 185)`
- Behavior: Remains at fixed location for player interactions

#### Technical Implementation

- Boundary validation occurs at two levels: decision generation and movement execution
- Euclidean distance calculation for radius checks
- Infinite distance for cross-map movement in restricted modes
- Integration with existing NPCMovementManager and event-driven movement system

### WARP P2P Client

The **[WARP-p2p-client](https://github.com/iskandarsulaili/WARP-p2p-client)** is the C++ WebRTC client implementation that connects to the rathena-AI-world P2P coordinator service. It enables hybrid P2P architecture where players can host game zones while maintaining centralized AI NPCs and authentication.

**Version**: 2.0.0 - ✅ Production-Ready (All 26 Security & Functionality Fixes Complete)

### ⚠️ Important: P2P is Completely Optional

**The P2P system is entirely optional and can be disabled at any time:**
- When P2P is disabled or unavailable, the system **automatically falls back** to traditional server routing
- Players experience **no difference in gameplay** when P2P is disabled
- The fallback is **transparent** - no manual intervention required
- You can enable/disable P2P per zone or globally via configuration

**P2P provides benefits when enabled:**
- Reduced server load in high-traffic zones
- Lower latency for player-to-player interactions
- Distributed bandwidth usage

**But the game works perfectly without it** - P2P is a performance enhancement, not a requirement.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ WebRTC-based P2P connections for zone hosting
- ✅ Automatic host discovery and selection
- ✅ Secure communication with SSL certificate verification
- ✅ **Automatic graceful fallback** to main server when P2P unavailable
- ✅ Performance monitoring and host validation
- ✅ **NEW**: Packet hooking for transparent P2P routing
- ✅ **NEW**: JWT token refresh with 7-day expiration
- ✅ **NEW**: Rate limiting (token bucket algorithm)
- ✅ **NEW**: Session health monitoring with auto-cleanup
- ✅ **NEW**: NPC state broadcasting
- ✅ **NEW**: Prometheus metrics for monitoring

**Integration**: The WARP client connects to the P2P coordinator service (`rathena-AI-world/src/p2p-coordinator`) via WebSocket signaling at `/api/v1/signaling/ws`. See [P2P_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md](../P2P_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed integration requirements.

**Architecture**: Hybrid P2P model where:
- **Centralized**: AI NPCs, authentication, anti-cheat, critical game logic (always active)
- **P2P**: Zone-based player interactions, reducing server load and latency (optional, with automatic fallback)

**Documentation**:
- [WARP P2P Client README](../WARP-p2p-client/README.md) - Overview and features
- [P2P DLL Deployment Guide](../WARP-p2p-client/P2P-DLL/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) - Complete deployment guide with all 26 fixes
