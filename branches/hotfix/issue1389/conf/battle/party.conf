show_steal_in_same_party: no

// Interval before updating the party-member map mini-dots (milliseconds)
party_update_interval: 1000

party_hp_mode: 0

// NOTE:
// The level range for sharing within a party is set in conf/inter_athena.conf
// under the value "party_share_level".

// When 'Party Share' item sharing is enabled in a party, 
// announce in the party which party-member received the item and what's he received? (Note 1)
show_party_share_picker: yes

// What types of items are going to be announced when 'show_party_share_picker' is active?
// 1:   IT_HEALING,  2:   IT_UNKNOWN,  4:    IT_USABLE, 8:    IT_ETC,
// 16:  IT_WEAPON,   32:  IT_ARMOR,    64:   IT_CARD,   128:  IT_PETEGG,

// 3: 1+2
party_item_share_type: 0

// Is exp/item sharing disabled for idle members in the party?
// Set to no, or the amount of seconds (NOT milliseconds) that need to pass before considering
// a character idle.
// Characters in a chat/vending are always considered idle.
// A character's idle status is reset upon item use/skill use/attack (auto attack counts too)/movement.
idle_no_share: no

// Give additional experience bonus per party-member involved on even-share parties (excluding yourself)?
// ex. If set to 10, an even-share party of 5 people will receive +40% exp (4 members * 10% exp):
//     140% party experience in total, so each member receives 140%/5 = 28% exp (instead of 20%).
party_even_share_bonus: 0

// Display party name regardless if player is in a guild.
// Official servers do not display party name unless the user is in a guild. (Note 1)
