10/24	
	* Added files common/showmsg.c/.h which contain the function _ShowMessage(char *string, int flag) [MC Cameri]
	  -Check showmsg.h to see how to use it.
	  -This function is made to replace printf in all the cases, so it MUST be used instead of print from now on.
	  -Begin your own journey of replacing/removing old printfs, and using the new function.
	  -This function was previously called ShowMessage() in oA, it is now merged, some changes have been done:
		1.Outputting messages to a file is now disabled(commented out).
		2.MSG_SQL is now commented out.
		3.If the server is out of memory, it will not use abort().
		4.Returns 0 if successful, 1 otherwise.
	  -Example: ShowInfo("hello\n"); will print this to the screen: [Info]: hello
	  -Always add \n at the end. Unless someone edits the function to add the \n whether it exists or not.
	  -Just add #include "showmsg.h" wherever you need it.

          machines that have no detectable IP addresses.. is this
          possible?  [MouseJstr]
                src\char_sql\char.c src\char\char.c src\map\map.c
	* Made it compile under gcc 2.95 [MouseJstr]
	* made the char and map servers auto-configure their own IP's
	  whenever possible [MouseJstr]

	  If you do not specify the server IP address, it now determines it
	  on its own.  This means that to get a server running that is
	  accessable from the internet you should only need to specify the
	  location of the data.grf files.  This eliminates one more point
	  of misconfiguration.

	  It does not correctly auto-configure for when you are behind a 
	  router or a firewall since there is no way of determining the 
	  external IP address.  On the other hand, we should be able to 
	  eliminate the lan_conf file since we know our IP addresses as well 
	  as our netmask.
