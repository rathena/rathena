//Notice\\

This branch, "Trunk", might not be stable due to bugs and whatsoever. 
It is highly recommended, if you have any doubts on using this svn version,
it is best if you use a RAthena Official Version or use the Stable branch.

on another note, if you found a bug, it is best if you report it on the RAthena 
forums as http://rathena.org/board/ . If you have made yourself a fix for 
that piece of faulty/buggy code, why not post it up and we'll add it to the svn.
who knows, you might be an aspiring dev.
