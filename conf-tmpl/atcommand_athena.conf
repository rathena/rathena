// Athena atcommand Configuration file.
// Translated by Peter Kieser <pfak@telus.net>

// Set here the symbol that you want to use for your commands
// Only 1 character is get (default is character_savecharacter_save'@'). You can set any character,
// except control-character (0x00-0x1f), '%' (party chat speaking) and '/' (standard ragnarok GM commands)
// With default character, all commands begin by a '@': <example> @revive
command_symbol: @


// Sets the level of the users that can use the GM commands.
// <command name>: level
// When battle_athena.conf has atcommand_gm_only set to no,
// normal players (gm level 0) can use GM commands if you set 0 to the command level.
// Max GM level is 99. If you want forbid a command to all people, set it with level 100.

// Default values are set to define different GM levels like follow:
// 0: normal player
//    -> no special advantage (only @time to know time and if at_command_gm_only is disabled)
// 1: Super player
//    -> some (very) little advantages: storage, petrename, etc...
// 10: Super player+
//    -> same of Super player with !go (very super player)
// 20: Mediator
//    -> it's a GM that only need to know people, and move to their to speak with them (they can access to any command about wisps)
// 40: Sub-GM
//    -> This GM can help a GM, and can not create item or zeny or modify a character (can have some information commands)
// 50: Sub-GM+
//    -> This GM can change some non-important things on a character
// 60: GM
//    -> can do almost anything (excep administration, and mass commands)
//       GM is the first level where we can modify a character with important value, create items or create zenys
// 80: GM Chief
//    -> can do anything, except administration commands
// 99: Administrator
//    -> can do anything!
// 100: Disabled
//    -> Commands that aren't used. Note: You must use command level 100 to disable command. Commenting doesn't enough.
