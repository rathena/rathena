---------------------------------------

AttackDelay: Attack Delay of the monster, also known as ASPD. Low value means faster attack speed, but don't make it too low or it will lag when a player got mobbed by several of these mobs.

---------------------------------------

AttackMotion: Attack animation motion. Low value means monster's attack will be displayed in higher FPS (making it shorter, too). (Thanks to Wallex for this)

---------------------------------------

ClientAttackMotion: The time from the start of a normal attack until the damage frame shows on client. At the same time you also get stopped on the client.
This value is only needed if you use the "synchronize_damage" feature (battle/battle.conf).

If you created a custom sprite, you want to set this value to the timing of the damage frame in your *.act file.
In Act Editor you can set the damage frame by setting the frame sound to "atk". If you don't define a damage frame, it will default to the second to last
frame. Also keep in mind that the Act Editor displays slightly inaccurate speed. Every 25ms in Act Editor is 24ms in reality.

Example: Drops has a animation speed of 24ms per frame and the 13th frame (frame #12) is the damage frame. This means the damage shows after 12 frames.
That's why Drops has a ClientAttackMotion of 24*12 = 288.

---------------------------------------

DamageMotion: Damage animation motion, same as aMotion but used to display the "I am hit" animation. Coincidentally, this same value is used to determine how long it is before the monster/player can move again. Endure is dMotion = 0, obviously.

---------------------------------------

GroupId: Group ID applied on the monster. It will only work on mobs if battle_config.show_mob_info is not enabled.
