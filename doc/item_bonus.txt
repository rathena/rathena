                                     	NOTE: If 'x' is negative value, then it's a part of formula:
                                     	      chance = -n*(killed_mob_level/10)+1
                                     	NOTE: Officially, the drop bonus for groups always activates to 100% so n should be 10000 for all
                                              official items. The actual drop rate of each item is defined in the item_group_db instead.
                                              Please note that each time only one random item in the group is checked for its drop rate.
                                              That means that the chance is divided by the number of items in the group.
