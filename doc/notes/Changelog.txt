2005/10/31
	* Fixed all players having the "plant" mode on... [Skotlex]
	* Added a timer to delay the automatic respawn of characters in gvg or pvp
	  grounds. The delay is currently 1 second, but be warned that because of
	  this it may be possible to revive the character if some priest is insanely
	  fast as there's currently no way to "prevent" a character from being
	  resurrected. [Skotlex]
	* More and more new quest skills! :3 [DracoRPG]
	* Removed the setting where characters could logout overriding the
	  prevent_logout setting if they were dead (it made it extremely easy to
	  accidentally log out if you were killed while trying to escape) [Skotlex]
	* Changed prevent_logout from yes/no to a "duration in ms" setting.
	  Defaults to 10secs (10000ms), note the client always says "wait 10 seconds"
	  regardless of the value of this setting. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the status change of SC_RIDING/SC_FALCON from clif_changeoption to
	  pc_changeoption which correctly makes the falcon/riding states end on quit.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Mob ai fix (mobs locking down into one target forever even if they should
	  be able to change targets) [Skotlex]
	* Added routine to check party share level whenever one of the members
	 levels up. It's checked on the map server, and then a share request is sent
	  to the char-server if party_share_level is broken. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected "show drain" to show nothing if the leeched values are
	  non positive. [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed Wand of Hermode not blocking the caster from walking.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied Silent's fix to @where [Skotlex]
	* Code cleanup regarding sign/unsigned comparisons. [Skotlex]
	* Updates to new quest skills, some are fully functionnal, some half, some
	  not at all xD. [DracoRPG]
2005/10/30
	* Fixed a bug that broke pet skills. [Skotlex]
	* @follow: Now to stop following, you may just type @follow, thx2Sartory [Lupus]
	* Fixed & finished what I did yesterday with SCs and quest skills, thanks
	  to Silent. [DracoRPG]
2005/10/29
	* Reorganized SC IDs to make room for 2nd jobs quest skills statuses: upped
	  SC_SENDMAX to 300 and moved all required SC to 300+. BEWARE: as a side-
	  effect of this, you might get 'glue boots' if an SC was saved and cannot
	  be restored because the ID isn't used anymore, this should only happen
	  with bonuses from cooked foods & dances/songs (unlikely since they last 20
	  seconds only), and maybe a few other such things. Simply remove lines
	  with SC IDs above 200 in your sc_data file/table. [DracoRPG]
	* Changed a bit the way Plant Cultivation fails: when it fails because of
	  missing items, it does nothing and displays "Skill had failed"; when the
	  50% success rate test fails, the effect is displayed but no plant summoned.
	  How should it work exactly? Because previous way was a bit confusing for
	  the player, not explaining why it failed, so I'd like to know. [DracoRPG]
	* Changed food cooking success rate to unmodifiable 50%, temporary value
	  waiting for accurate data ;) [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the code in skill.c so that skills are considered as guild skills
	  (for things such as inf, maxlv, etc) only when their ID >= 10k, enables
	  use of 2nd jobs quest skills with 1k+ IDs, thanks to Silent. [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the Flag guild script. Now one can only flag in using the flags infront 
	  of the castle. [Kayla]
	* Removed most of the built-in zlib files and the LOCALZLIB compile option
	  Note: All native Windows builds now require zlib1.dll, you can just download
	  it from http://www.zlib.org and place it in the main directory [celest]
	* Changed the unzip library to be static linked instead of dynamic [celest]
	* Small fix to the trading routing, should fix items with the no-trade flag
	  being able to be vended. [Skotlex]
2005/10/28
	* Fixed the size of the equip_job field in SQL item_db/item_db2, thanks to
	  blackhole89. [DracoRPG]
	* Harmonized the way NPC events such as PCLoadMapEvent, PCBaseLvUpEvent, etc
	  are implemented. Caution, now PCLoadMapEvent NPC is called globally: it
	  is not needed to put it in a specific map. Use script functions to know
	  which map the player has been warped to. Thanks to Z3RO. [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the names of the job level up char commands. [Skotlex]
	* Tiny change to the script engine which may fix those crashes. [Skotlex]
	* Added blocking use of skills while sitting. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented Trancid's expanded global announce system. [Skotlex]
2005/10/27
	* Applied Ilpalazzo-sama/Zzo's patch that cleans up and fixes some bugs
	  with the script engine. [Skotlex]
	* Made land protectors from enemies cancel each other out. [Skotlex]
	* Made it so Guardians/Emperiums with no owning guild can be attacked out
	  of woe. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected being able to attack and use skills during the first interval
	  of Petrify [Skotlex]
	* Fixed packet exploit that allowed you to produce multiple times without
	  first triggering the skill. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up/simplified the implementation of SC_NOCHAT [Skotlex]
	* Added file upgrade_svn3746.sql, use it to alter your `char` table column
	  "manner", which should NOT be unsigned (if your column already is
	  signed, then no need to apply this update) [Skotlex]
	* More code cleanup to make eA ANSI-C compliant. [Skotlex]
	* Some fixes to the night-day-system. [Skotlex]
2005/10/26
	* Some more multi-map server work. It seems to work now correctly and with
	  no memory leaks, however it likely needs more testing. Also added the
	  support into the char-TXT server. [Skotlex]
	* Patched a crash where mobs with no space for looting would attempt to
	  loot. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mapflags, readded gvg_dungeon. Now mapflags work according to
	  this post: [Skotle]
	  http://eathena.ws/board/index.php?showtopic=58201
	* Likely fixed Party Even Share. [Skotlex]
	* Added map flag "nightenabled", only maps with this flag will display the
	  night effect when it's night. Said maps are specified in mapflag/night.txt [Skotlex]
	* Modified map flags gvg and gvg_dungeon. gvg now is basicly the same as
	  pvp, except guilds are automatically teamed up, while gvg_dungeon was
	  removed and replaced by gvg_castle, which is the flag now used for castle
	  maps which only modify the behaviour during WoE times. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the login/char TXT Makefiles so the TXT_ONLY flag is passed, this
	  SHOULD fix the guild size mismatch errors... [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed a char-server crash related to whispers. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the custom jobmaster so it should stop second advanced classes
	  from being able to re-change jobs. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented dynamix's night system which uses a status change rather than
	  the "darkness levels", said config option removed as is no longer needed.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Some fixes to the char-sql code when sending chars to another map server.
	  [Skotlex]
	* LuzZza's ported Trade/Vending additional antispoof checks [Lupus]
	- thanks to Yor&Freya Team. So LuzZza is our new dev (it was his 2nd test)
2005/10/25
	* Some work fixing up multi-map servers. It should now *work*, however each
	  time the player swaps map-server it triggers all the relevant
	  on-login/on-logout events, which likely needs to be corrected at a later
	  date. Only SQL has been updated so far, TXT is still pending. [Skotlex]
	* Updated GrandCross so it does half damage on the caster (+half damage
	  from Faith, it does just 25% or less damage to self now) [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_check_target to consider normal mobs as always belonging
	  to the same party (should fix them fighting out when pkmode is on)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the Makefile for TXT char/login servers (fixes guild structure size
	  mismatches) [Skotlex]
	* Added script command "playerattached", returns the char_id of the player
	  currently attached to the script, 0 if there's no player attached (or
	  attached player is no longer on the map server) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @changegm in the char-txt server. [Skotlex]
	* Some code cleanup to make eA ANSI-C complaint (not quite there, but
	  closer) [Skotlex]
2005/10/24
	* Applied Ilpalazzo-sama/zzo's patch that optimizes the status_get_*
	  functions. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed changegm (as far as I know) [Skotlex]
	* Modified again the code that checks who and what can target traps. It
	  should be set to only let heaven's drive, arrow shower and remove trap
	  target them. [Skotlex]
	* Breaker now ignores mdef. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed script command "makeitem" to only require an attached player if the
	  map is defined as "this". [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_check_target to enable only skills with inf 32 (can target
	  traps) to hit traps. Implementation may not be perfect depending on how
	  the client reacts to the associated skill_db change. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up battle_weapon_attack. [Skotlex]
	* Some optimizations to the struct mob_data. [Skotlex]
	* Applied Ipalazzo-sama/zzo's memory optimization patches. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some quests and updated item_db. [Kayla]
	* Updated Grimtooth to cause "Stop" on enemies instead of slow down. The
	  duration used is now skill's time 2. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the mob_ai code so they do nothing if they were attacked but
	  can't attack back (and it did not invoke a rude attacked, that is,
	  monster_ai does not has 2 set) [Skotlex]
2005/10/23
	* Some fixes to @charmountpeco [Skotlex]
	* Some cleanups to pet.c, fixes pet_timer being invoked when the pet is
	  idle. [Skotlex]
	* Added a clause to ignore name solve requests of chat-rooms (for some
	  reason the client requests them...) [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to the latest. [Skotlex]
	* Removed that mob_spawn_once message that is just a debug message with no
	  real purpose anymore. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed forging displaying success even when it fails. [Skotlex]
	* Changed main.sql so that sc_data only has indexes, not a primary key
	  (I keep hearing mysql can't handle a triple column PK...) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Doublecast's success chance [Skotlex]
	* 'Fixed' the warning on @reloadscript (just removed the warning and
	  avoided memory leaks, because properly unloading the user functions and
	  reloading them I could not get done) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed possible crash due to custom packets, thanks to Andz for the info.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob's Scream/Frost Joke crashing the server if the message was too
	  long [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the wrong attribute being passed to the attribute fix in
	  battle_calc_magic attack (strange deja vu feeling.. I am sure I fixed this
	  same bug before).  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed trading. [Skotlex]
	* Removed Mastery damage being applied to Grand Cross [Skotlex]
	* Some more fine-tuning of the Grand Cross equation. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mobs that couldn't attack not being able to use skills (first half
	  of why marine spheres were broken). [Skotlex]
	* Updated summoned marine spheres so they can move (second half of why
	  marine spheres were broken). [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the produce system for mixed foods creation [DracoRPG]
	* Small changes and optimizations to battle_calc_magic_attack, replaced redundant
	  magic_subrace with missing magic_addsize, updated crappy doc about it [DracoRPG]
2005/10/22
	* Modified Finger Offensive's formula to be 100% + 50%*skilllv which seems
	  to be a more factually correct equation than what is shown in the websites.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Applied Ilpalazzo-sama's patch which speeds up the data zeroing in
	  status_calc_pc. [Skotlex]
	* Crashfix on invalid lines when reading castle_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Updated GrandCross's damage formula according to Komurka's information.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Also, now skills that ignore card modifiers only ignore the attacker's
	  card modifiers, no the target's (does not apply to skills like Pressure
	  that do fixed damage). [Skotlex]
	* Updated Bowling bash damage, knockback to current Kro values. [Skotlex]
	* Modified NPC_EMOTION and NPC_EMOTION_ON so they can be used to modify the
	  current mob's mode (instead of setting it). [Skotlex]
	- Some examples:
		1269,Clock@NPC_EMOTION_ON,attack,474,1,10000,0,30000,yes,self,always,0,6,4,300,,,
	  Adds mode 4 (aggressive) for 300 seconds to Clocks when attacking.
		1193,Alarm@NPC_EMOTION,chase,197,1,200,0,5000,yes,self,always,0,19,4,10,,,
	  Removes the aggressive mode (4) from Alarms when chasing for 10 seconds.
	- After a mob's mode is changed, their state is reset so they can stop
		chasing/seek a target.
	* Made GrimTooth be longranged, Soul Drain work only on targetted skills,
	  and Extremity Fist only checks for enemy state right before attacking (I am
	  not sure it is 100% as it should be still, though) [Skotlex]
	* Eh.. now Safety Wall blocks all skills tagged as short-ranged. Report any
	  anomalies this causes. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for global mob skills. In essence, you can now specify a
	  mob skill that is added to ALL mobs in a single line by using negative
	  class IDs. -1 adds the skill to normal mobs, -2 adds the skill to
	  bosses, and -3 to both. For example:
	  -1,All@AL_HEAL,any,28,10,10000,500,5000,yes,friend,friendhpltmaxrate,60,,,,,,
	  Adds Heal Lv10 to all normal mobs.
	* Readded the level up buff bonus from the Taekwon class T.T [Skotlex]
2005/10/21
	* Removed the level up buff bonus from the Taekwon class T.T [Skotlex]
	* Small change in mob_ai_sub_hard which may fix mobs casting their Rude
	  Attacked skill when they shouldn't. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the code so that SNovice Steel Body should trigger inmediately upon
	  death, and bypass the exp loss penalty. [Skotlex]
	* Added Taekwon boy to the buff on level up system. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Skills checking for water-cells instead of Land Protector cells.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added config option skillrange_by_distance, makes skills be long/short
	  ranged based on the source/target distance. Defaults to 6 (mobs + pets).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Magic Power totally messing up matk. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Meteor Storm [Skotlex]
	* Some changes to Moonlight Petals, it should make the skill finally be
	  considered an ensemble skill. [Skotlex]
	* Updated skill_split_atoi to guess linear increases up to half of the data
	  provided. This means it can understand the more complex cast times of
	  skills such as Meteor and Soul Strike. If you provide the data of ten
	  levels, then it will check for patterns up to 5 steps long (meaning that
	  the diff between 1 and 6 is the same as the diff between 2 and 7 and so on,
	  and if they all match, the tested pattern is applied all the way to level
	  100) [Skotlex]
	* Some modifications to Magic Power, it should hopefully be working now. [Skotlex]
	* Cleanups and fixes to Tarot Card. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a screwup in skill_split_atoi which was corrupting the skill db. [Skotlex]
	* Free up block chunks allocated by the memory manager when shutting down [celest]
	* Updated packets in packet_db and clif.c [celest]
2005/10/20
	* Turned on the error_log by default (had this been on before, I would had
	  noticed why Longing for Freedom was not working several WEEKS ago >.<)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Longing for Freedom [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed even-share party on char relog exploit. [Skotlex]
	* Modified Land Protector so it behaves more like Basilica. [Skotlex]
	* Removed GM account reading from the char-sql server and moved it into
	  the login-sql server (Ancyker requested this was fixed... and this is how
	  it was working on the TXT servers) [Skotlex]
	* Modified skill_split_atoi so it can guess linear changes in the values
	  and fill out the rest of the array correctly (eg: blowcount is defined as
	  1:2:3:4:5, now the function can understand that and fill the rest of values
	  with 6:7:8:9:10 and so on. It can also understand two-step increases, if
	  the value is 1:2:2:3:3:4, it can guess that the following values should be
	  4:5:5:6:6:7:7 and so on). This allows mobs to cast stuff like Thunderstorm
	  LV67 without the need of manually updating the dbs with the corresponding
	  values :O [Skotlex]
	* Fixed monster_ai&1 doing the opposite of what it should do. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the skill unit reiteration code so that it'll work with any AoE
	  skill that is set to not reiterate in skill_unit_db.txt, when no
	  reiteration is set, the skill cannot be stacked with itself, but it can
	  be placed on top of other AoE skills (except for Pneuma, Safety Wall,
	  Warp Portal, Basilica and the Hunter traps who all have their own checks
	  hardcoded) [Skotlex]
	* Modified the way Magic Power works for AoE magic skills, it should now
	  work correctly for all AoE spells including Meteor. [Skotlex]
	* Added mode "change target" (0x200 = 512) to specify mobs that can change
	  target while attacking. Since no mob in the db has been updated yet to
	  include this mode, for the time being all aggressive mobs will also be
	  considered as "change target" types (which is how eA has been managing it
	  up to this point) [Skotlex]
	* Added a check in status_check_skilluse to make AoE skills fail if the
	  caster is standing on Basilica. [Skotlex]
	* Reduced a bit the size of the party structure. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Play Dead [Skotlex]
	* Reverted a memory fix in script.c which causes a crash.. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted a small change which likely made magic power not work anymore on
	  ground skills. [Skotlex]
2005/10/19
	* Added an SQL update update_logs2.sql Use it for more effecient work of your MySQL server [Luups]
	* Likely fixed Root and the Wedding Skills [Skotlex]
	* Fixed that crash in skill_use_id.. oops. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed demonstration triggering status effects. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed ground placed skills causing skill_counter_additional_effect
	  triggering on the skill's owner. [Skotlex]
	* Added corrections/checks that should prevent the char servers from
	  crashing if they parse a packet from a client where the session data is
	  expected to be but is not set. [Skotlex]
	* Converted NPC_STOP to a status-inducing effect, SC_STOP which prevents
	  characters from moving. [Skotlex]
	* General checks and cleanup (new function pc_can_move) to prevent chars
	  from walking when they shouldn't be able to. [Skotlex]
	* Some changes to int_party, which may prevent crashes due to large parties
	  in congested situations. [Skotlex]
	* Software Caused Connection Abort errors should inmediately terminate the
	  connection now (rather than waiting for the timeout) [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed Basilica by making battle_check_target use the mapcell
	  instead of the status change when deciding the enemy state. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed being able to enable NPC clicks while a trading window is open. [Skotlex]
	* Added status change SC_MODE which allows to temporarily override a mob's
	  mode. It can be invoked through mob skills NPC_EMOTION and NPC_EMOTION_ON
	  using the second and third value (new mode and duration in seconds,
	  respectively). Example:
		1269,Clock@NPC_EMOTION_ON,attack,474,1,10000,0,30000,yes,self,always,0,6,133,300,,,
	  Makes the Clock do the /an emotion, and his mode changes to 133 (can
	  move, can attack, aggressive) for the following 300 seconds (if the mode
	  is 0, then the mode is not changed).
	- Note that when a mob gets their mode changed, their state is reset (so
	  they stop attacking/chasing)
	- Because of this update, the code that made mobs give up chasing after a
	  while is no longer needed and hence, removed.
	* Implemented function status_check_skilluse which checks whether a skill
	  (or melee attack) can be used on an enemy based on their status (restricts
	  skills that may be used if opponent is cloaked/hidden, or blocks Aex
	  Aeterna if opponent is petrified/frozen, blocks skills while silenced, etc
	  etc). Note that the code simplification/modification is big, so beware of
	  any new bugs that might have been caused by the function. [Skotlex]
2005/10/18
	* Fixed card set bonuses for sure this time (or so I hope) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the Dissonance song bug which allowed you to cast a song afterwards
	  and it would not follow you around. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the counting function to never count in skills (traps, AoE
	  skills) since traps were always being counted in for stuff like Napalm
	  beat/Blitz Beat/etc. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Devotion/Sacrifice check which should enable recasting on
	  characters. Thanks to Irmin for pointing it out. [Skotlex] 
	* Fixed offensive heal so it fails if not used on an enemy (instead of
	  failing when used on an ally). [Skotlex]
	* Modified the char servers so they do a party range check when a character
	  logs in. This should fix parties keeping their even share even after a
	  low-level member rejoins the server. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob AI so that aggressive mobs will change targets if they are
	  attacked and their current target isn't attacking them (regardless of
	  range) [Skotlex]
	* Some updates to the pet AI so their chase range is range3 instead of the
	  hardcoded value of 13. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Mika's fix since it makes it impossible for mobs to heal each
	  other. (what is the so called exp bug about?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a possible crash in clif_equiplist(), thanks to Zoc [Skotlex]
	* Spells are now considered a "miss" if they do no damage (this prevents
	  additional effects from triggering out such as freezing) [Skotlex]
	* Temp bug fix of Exp increase when healing non-undead mob (by MiKa) [Lupus]
2005/10/17
	* Updated sql-files/mob_db.sql to match with the current one. [Skotlex]
	  (someone else also did this, but missed a few values from Incantation
	  Samurai. Altough who did it and why it is failed to be mentioned in the
	  log files?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed alchemists not being able to hit their marine spheres (how many
	  times this same bug keeps coming back from the dead anyway?) [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to the current item_db.txt [Skotlex]
	*  Fixed magic rod not cancelling the additional effects from skills. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the card inserting code to prevent crashes from modified
	  packets. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed offensive heal [Skotlex]
	* Applied a random chance when reducing the mob's chase duration. This
	  should randomize how long the mob chases you around before giving up.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Some modifications to the timer push heap function, may fix timer issues
	  when creating timers with tick values that overflow. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the mob ai so it has a seek time, when the min_chase runs out
	  (it is constantly decreased while chasing, starts out at range3) the mob
	  will stop chasing, do a /swt, and stop being aggro for 10 secs. This is how
	  it should be according to what I understood from Komurka's explanation.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added config monster_ai, it determines some of the mob behaviour:
	- If &1, mobs will use hard path finding to reach their target, otherwise
	  only easy (straight line) path searches will be used (for most offensive
	  purposes).
	- If &2, mobs will use the rude attacked skill if they can't attack back no
	  matter what, otherwise they use it only if they can't reach the target.
	  [Skotlex]
	- Still pending on what other things it could define. Currently defaults to
	  0 (seems to be the official mob ai) [Skotlex]
	* Now Atk/Matk potions duration don't get automatically multiplied by 1000,
	  duration must be specified in ms in the scripts. [Skotlex]
	* Made all mobs with no guild belong to the same guild, this should prevent
	  mobs from attacking each other on WoE. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Into the Abyss + retrieving traps related exploits. [Skotlex]
	* Changed monster_skill_nofootset to no to enable mobs casting stuff like
	  Bomb underneath characters. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Sacrifice, it can now be recasted on a player as long as it's by
	  the same crusader that is currently protecting the player. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some unitialized values error in magic and misc attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed  30% bonus from upper/baby classes affecting card bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed baseClass not working on Acolyte class, thanks to Silent. [Skotlex]
	* Made the stone curse animation only show up on successfully cursing. [Skotlex]
	* Added Meditation's bonus to offensive heal, thanks to Orn. [Skotlex]
	* Made devotion fail when already used on a char with that effect. [Skotlex]
	* Made it so you can't quit while cloaking/hiding, and said status will end
	  on quit if force-quitting. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up and fixed isequipped script commands, it should be working
	  correctly now (tested with the Assassin combo) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed not stacking Long Attack Rate bonuses [Lupus]
	- Bow Thimble +3%, Archer Skeleton Card +10%, Merman Card(when CARDS COMBO) +20%
	- We should get rid of that +-15% ranged damage varianc (it doesn't cure "stoprate bug" anyways)
2005/10/16
	* Fixed wrong calculation of items max drop chance (when using MySQL MOB DB) [Lupus]
	* Added nomemo mapflag to more levels of Thanatos Tower, thx2Justin84 [Lupus]
2005/10/14
	* Updated the gvg_dungeon mapflag to mean "guild versus guild regardless of
	  woe schedule" and set it on the guild versus guild maps. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed perfect hiding. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up (or rewrote?) the Run and High Jump code to merge them better
	  with the normal walking routines. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Turn Undead from ignoring element. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Power Thrust Max & Power Thrust so that they don't stack (and
	  only PT Max cancels PT) [Skotlex]
	* Some fine tuning in battle_check_attackable. [Skotlex]
	* Changed db_final's implementation to End of Exam's. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Guardian removal routines to also update/save their respective
	  Castle data (Guardian HP and visibility) [Skotlex]
	* Added map server setting "enable_spy", must be set to yes/on for @spy
	  commands to work. [Skotlex]
	* Applied End of Exam's fix to the previous fix to the db. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed spyguild/spyparty sending packets to the spied guild/party instead
	  of your own. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the card hash implementation. Now it should work correctly for
	  any card set on any equipped item. Supports up to 4 slots in any of the
	  equipped items. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the mob ai so it stops chasing right away if you
	  hide/cloak/vanish/etc. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some memory issues in the db handling. Credits to End of Exam.
	  [Skotlex]
2005/10/13
	* Updated the main.sql file with some of the recommendations by Zoc
	  [Skotlex]
	- If your sc_data table works as it is, you don't have to touch it.
	* Fixed Maxmize Power/Cloaking sending the sever to an "infinite loop" when
	  used by mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning to clif_send in regards to guild-related packets. [Skotlex]
	* Added mob skill condition "afterskill", works like "skillused" except
	  it's triggered after the mob was the one doing the mentioned skill.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Small cleanup and optimization of data saved when received member
	  information. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some memory issues in script loading and the plugin loading
	  mechanism. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed magic attacks always doing minimum damage. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the crash in battle_check_attackable [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Fireball hitting twice on the targetted mob. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Recall Guild to work in gvg maps even if the nowarp flag is set.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Updated Recall Partner to warp partner after 20 secs the thing is on the
	  ground, skill is blocked from reusage during that time. [Skotlex]
	* Some updates to correctly decide whether skills hit cloaking and/or
	  hidden chars. [Skotlex]
	* Updated skill code so that heaven's drive will hit and destroy traps
	  (untested), also AoE skills will not trigger on hidden characters. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the crash on magic rod. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Maximize Power and Cloaking to last forever (until reuse, I
	  believe) for non-players. [Skotlex]
	* Made Berserk end when you logout. [Skotlex]
	* Made song/dances end when you unequip your weapon rather than on equip.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed one bug in battle_calc_magic attack and some cleaning of it as
	  well. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/mob_db.sql to match the latest mob_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match the latest item_db.txt. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed stealing. Now it works like aegis one. [Lupus]
2005/10/12
	* Fixed everyone gaining high speed after casting a ground-based skill.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the magical part of Soul Breaker ignoring mdef. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Reverse Orcish to use the duration specified for the skill in
	  skill_cast_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Modified REVERSEORCISH to make it a status change (SC_ORCISH), since
	  there's no data about duration, defense, or if any stat reduces it's
	  duration, it currently is fixed to 5 minutes. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crash when sending the insert card packet with an invalid index. [Skotlex]
	* Added script constant baseClass. [Skotlex]
	- Example: if (baseClass == Job_Novice) will match on all novices and super
	  novices. if (baseClass == Job_Swordman) will match on all Swordmen, Knights
	  and Crusaders. Once tested several item scripts can be simplified in the
	  item_db.
	- In contrast, the already defined baseJob works by stripping the upper
	  kind only. (eg: baseJob == Job_Swordman matches on swordman classes, but
	  not Crusader/Knight)
	- I know the names can be confusing, but anyone has a better suggestion for
	  a name?
	* Added a fix to prevent people from buying equipment in stackable from by
	  hexing the packets and specifying an amount greater than 1. [Skotlex]
	- Thanks to End of Exam for pointing out the exploit.
	* Added flag "move delay" to skill_castnodex_db.txt [Skotlex]
	- By setting this flag to 1, players won't be able to move during the skill
	  delay time. Some reorganization was needed in skill.c to make room for
	  this, so some testing is required.
	* Fixed the Char SQL server unnecessarily loading AND saving parties each
	  time a party-member changed maps. [Skotlex]
	* Modified skill_min_damage so that it defines the minimum damage for
	  skills IF the skill does not misses/is blocked. Can be used to specify
	  to any of weapon attacks, magic attacks, or misc attacks. Defaults to 6
	  (magic + misc attacks) as that is what was set up previously. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Wand of Hermod and a potential crash related to ground based
	  skills. [Skotlex]
	* Probably corrected npc load count when using reloadscript. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed petheal [Skotlex]
	* Fixed PVP client crash bug. By a new cadidate into eA coders LuzZza [Lupus]
	* Updated maps comments, thanks to Justin84 [Lupus]
2005/10/11
	* Fixed not being able to cast resurrection on dead players. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed party HP update crash. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed players being killed always in one hit. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed chars not being able to unhide. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote/optimized the hp updating code (both party hp and disp_hpmeter),
	  this should lower bandwidth a bit from all the unnecessary packets that
	  were previously being sent. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the mysterious 2.2% drop chance for all items when read from the
	  sql db. [Skotlex]
	* Updated targeted skills and normal attacking to fail when targetting
	  hidden characters. [Skotlex]
	* Merged reddozen and Draco's code regarding TK skills. [Skotlex]
	* Added a function to allow guilds to delete alliances with nonexisting
	  guilds. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the weapon damage return in battle_weapon_attack, thanks to PeF
	  for pointing it out. [Skotlex]
	* Added max_baby_parameter to define the max parameter for baby classes.
	  Also fixed some instances where the baby parameter restriction was not
	  being taken into account. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Firewall doing knockback on the undead. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Waterball count when casted by non-players, thanks to Orn [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the instrument/whips gender restriction being applied to Cap. [Skotlex]
	* Damn typo: Fixed Mobs Drops with the same % droprate. thanx 2rover 4bugreport [Lupus]
	* Fixed SQL Mob DB reading(no drops issue, etc) thanx to yoanykim for pointing it out [Lupus]
2005/10/10
	* Probably fixed the peco-riding issue. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed clif_clearchar_delay (cause of the ghost mobs from my tests). [Skotlex]
	* Small fix on the mob ai (attacked_id was never being reset if the
	  attacker no longer exists). [Skotlex]
	* Added a couple of checks to prevent the mob_ai from executing if the mob
	  is dead. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a typo in skill_attack which causes all sort of unpredictable
	  behaviour, such as firewall never hitting. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a memory leak involving pets and cast cancel. [Skotlex]
	* Made Wand of Hermod end when the caster is moved for whatever reason. [Skotlex]
	* Increased the random damage delay modifier to +/-15% [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "rare drop filter" considering "available in shops only items" as RARE items [Lupus]
	* The GM can drop level now also determines whether a GM can store items in
	  the Guild Storage or not. Thanks to Kayla for pointing it out :P [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Grimtooth so that it's slowdown works on both players and mobs.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Fireball's damage. [Skotlex]
	* Now the Wedding Dress and Tuxedo will always check for the correct
	  gender. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the code for Potion Pitcher. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Falcon Assault to be 5x Blitz Beat's damage at level 5. [Skotlex]
	* The npc_counter is now reset in a @reloadscript. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up Falcon Assault and made it's %dmg increase be an addition on
	  top of Blitz Beat (altough I am not so sure that's right) [Skotlex]
	* Hardcoded the gender restrictions for items with view 13 & 14 (Musical
	  Instruments and Whips), changed ignore_item_genders to yes as default. [Skotlex]
	* Changed GX duration to 900ms. [Skotlex]
	* Cleared up the item get times descriptions in battle_athena.conf [Skotlex]
	* Some timer fixes in status_change_start regarding sc_data loading. [Skotlex]
2005/10/09
	* Probably fixed Waterball so it does max number of hits when casted by a
	  non-player regardless of water availability. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed perfect hiding. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected magic damage return to only work on targetted skills [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning up of the skill_attack function. [Skotlex]
	* At last finished 2 last logs filters options: [Lupus]
		- Implemented 'Rare' items option (you can set rare_items_log value)
		- Implemented 'Big amount' of items option (it would always log big set amount of items (per 1 action!) despite on the other filter option)
	* Updated @iteminfo ATcommand. It would show you additional item info. [Lupus]
		- Monsters drop this item with ?.?% chance
		- Monsters don't drop this item
		- This item is available in the shops only
	- Tip: When you Trade/Vend goods, use @iteminfo to check items price and even rareness ^_-
	* Rearranged item_data struct units to make it compatible with some old script commands after Skotlex's changes
	- Tip: Now you can use GetItemInfo script command to find out if the item is rare or not
2005/10/08
	* Some improvements to the mob ai. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed summoned marine spheres exploding on their own. [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed the attribute fix for magical attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Made the gender check to not be ignored by default [Skotlex]
	- This is necessary because the new job ID system makes both Dancer and
	  Bard be treated as the same job, so all bard/dancer comparisons were
	  changed to be gender comparisons, thus, the gender check is indispensable
	  for their weapons.
	* Updated item_db structure. new column upper (after equip_jobs) defines
	  the type of job that can equip the item (1: Normal jobs, 2: Upper jobs,
	  4: Baby jobs), merged the use_script and equip_script columns into one.
	  Also the equip_jobs column now has support for the following classes:
	  Taekwon (2^24), Star Gladiator (2^25) and Soul Linker (2^26)
	  The provided db/item_db.txt and sql-files/item_db,sql are already updated
	  with all the necessary changes (all equipable/usable items have their
	  upper set to 7)..
	- Lupus, Nexus, get working on updating the item_db.
	* Made FrostJoke/Scream work the same way out and inside woe grounds.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Grand Cross Damage [Skotlex]
2005/10/07
	* Took out Lighthalzen's noteleport mapflag. Added it by accident. [Nexon]
	* Some commented code cleanup and help.txt update [Foruken]
	* Applied Draco's fixes to battle_calc_magic_attack. [Skotlex]
	* Modified @showexp and @showdelay so they will work as people would expect
	  them to. [Skotlex]
	* Figured out what ## variables are, and documented it on
	  doc/script_commands.txt [Skotlex]
	* Foruken pointed out that the actual script problem was a certain
	  acalloc() that was changed to realloc(), so undid the last revert and
	  reverted this one instead.  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a char-sql issue where character variables seemed to be saving
	  incorrectly. [Skotlex]
	* Removed a free() that was added on R3421 that was supposed to fix a
	  memory leak but instead causes crashes :/ (so the memory leak is back in
	  there, but no more crash) [Skotlex] 
	* Applied End of Exam's script engine patch. [Skotlex]
	- This adds support for nested blocks, if/else, fors, switches. See
	  <http://eathena.deltaanime.net/board/index.php?showtopic=50037>
	  for more information. Note that he admits it is not fully tested, so be
	  careful when trying out the new commands!
2005/10/06
	* Some corrections to the script engine, should fix a few memory leaks.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Minor corrections to the screen output of the char_sql server when
	  saving. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected authorisation issues in msg_athena.conf [Skotlex]
	* Updated Wand of Hermod [Skotlex]
	- Can't amp out of it.
	- Affects everyone
	- Only prevents people from casting supportive skills.
	* Fixed mobs not doing their "rude-attacked" skill. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected casters being able to walk during Wand of Hermod [Skotlex]
	* Made Guild Recall be usable outside of WoE. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default gvg_traps_target_all to yes. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default for copyskill_restrict to 2 (cannot copy advanced
	  skills) [Skotlex]
	* Added a bunch of code related to the 2nd job quest skills and Tae -second
	  classes skills, as provided by Draco and acquired from jA [Skotlex]
	* Merged Draco's implementation of battle_calc_magic_attack. [Skotlex]
	* Modifications to the mob AI to more accurately use Range2 (mob's sight
	  range) and Range3 (mob's chase distance ability) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up item_db.txt, updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match. [Skotlex]
	* Added logarithmic drops support for TXT itemdb loading (how could I had
	  forgotten that?) [Skotlex]
	* Added battle options item_rate_treasure, item_drop_treasure_min,
	  item_drop_treasure_max, these override all other rate options when it comes
	  to Treasure box drops. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up battle_athena.conf regarding drop rates. mvp_item_rate has
	  been changed to item_rate_mvp. [Skotlex]
	* Implemented Maya Purple card effect (you can see any hidden mob). Thanks to jA [Lupus]
	* Updated functions: pc_calc_base_job,pc_calc_base_job2 [Lupus]
	- They return 24:Taekwon, 25:StarGladiator, 27:Soul Linker
	  Now someone should UPDATE Job fields of item_db.txt for TK,SL,SG classes
	  then I'll remove ugly hardcoded "temp plug" from pc_isequip function
	  [Item_DB JOB field note]: We don't check Knight2,Crusader2,Star Gladiator2 bits,
		so don't set them.
	  In other words we use only these bits:
		0-Novice,1-Swordman,2,3,4,5,6-Thief
		7-Knight,8,9,10,11,12-Assassin,14-Crusader,15,16,17,18,19,20-Dancer
		23-Super Novice
		24-TK,25-SG,27-SL
	  Don't ever use other bits e.g. for Advanced classes. It's useless
	* Added Poring Box logs (into dead branch logs)
2005/10/05
	* Updated nomemo and noteleports for Lighthalzen/Einbroch/Einbech maps and others. [Nexon]
	* Fixed the mob AI. [Skotlex]
	* Updated alchemist_summon_reward [Skotlex]
	- Summons now never give exp, and they may drop items according to setting:
	  0: Never drop items
	  1: Only Marine spheres drop items (default)
	  2: All summons drop items.
	  (maybe a different battle option can be made to make summons give exp?)
	* Simplified the Grand Cross code. [Skotlex]
	  It is now entirely a magical attack with extra damage of the form base
	  atk * skill%  - armor def% - vit def. Note that weapon properties won't
	  apply now as well as many of the offensive cards (those that do not apply
	  to both magic and weapon attacks, that is), and the def penalty from
	  having many mobs targeted on one is not applying neither (so the full
	  def is being taken into consideration). Report any corrections further
	  needed.
	* Cleaned up, organized and improved somewhat the mob ai code. [Skotlex]
	  (update and test at your own risk as I can't test it currently)
	* Some corrections to the way the guild master's name is updated during a
	  gm change. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to avoid saving negative durations for status changes. [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to avoid loading status changes with negative durations
	  (the walk freeze problems seem related to timers and sc_data loading, so I
	  am shooting in the dark here at possible problem sources) [Skotlex]
	* Various cleanups to ensemble related code, Longing For Freedom may be
	  working now. [Skotlex]
	* Added the water levels to ayo_dun01, gon_dun01 and lhz_dun03, thanks to
	  Master of Muppets [Skotlex]
	* Made Autocounter trigger autospells (was not doing so because it's NK
	  defines it as a no-damage skill) [Skotlex]
	* Some cleanups on the mob slave AI code. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config retaliate_to_master, defaults to yes. [Skotlex]
	- Why? Because in official, summoned mobs are not attacked by other mobs
	  (speaking about alchemists), if you set this to no, then mobs will
	  retaliate against the summon (both @summon and alchemist ones).
	* Some fixes to the way the guildmaster flag is being set and checked. [Skotlex]
	* Made the skilllv be 1 if the client sends less than that (this is why
	  active guild skills were not working. For some reason the client was
	  sending a request to do the skill at level 0!) [Skotlex]
2005/10/04
	* Likely fixed Aeterna + Soul Breaker/Destroyer. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning of the mob ai. May help with some of the current exploits.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Mob_ai code to make supportive mobs properly gang up on
	  summons. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the plagiarize code to execute it before dealing damage (because on
	  WoE you are auto-restored when you get killed, hence the player was 'alive'
	  and it would copy the skill when killed by it on WoE) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Classical Pluck blocking AoE spells. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Spider Web code to not retrigger if already trapped by one
	  (needed because spider webs can now stack) [Skotlex]
2005/10/03
	* Fixed a mistake with my last fix. [Kevin]
	* Fixed often occurring memory leak in clif.c. [Kevin]
	* Made NPC_DARKCROSS work (it's just a copy of Holy Cross with dark
	  attribute) [Skotlex]
	* Removed resetting the manner when a player is saved. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up map reading code to make it remove maps that could not be
	  loaded. It prevents crashes related to maps that weren't correctly loaded
	  on startup. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Endure to make it add armor mdef. [Skotlex]
	* Small fixes to updating the guild master's name during a guild master
	  change. [Skotlex]
	* Some corrections to the mob ai to enable mobs to attack other mobs
	  (summoned ones, of course) [Skotlex]
	* Updated autotrading so that the char will close the shop and quit the map
	  server automatically when there's nothing left to vend. [Skotlex]
	* Added checks to prevent a char from joining/creating multiple chat rooms
	  (anti-crash fix, it is). [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up and restructured the mob item drop code. It also fixes a
	  possible crash during the autoloot check. [Skotlex]
	* Reupdated Wind Walk to add +5% flee bonus... AGAIN. [Skotlex]
2005/10/02
	* Fixed STEAL issue. [Lupus]
	- Any Mob has 10 drop slots. If we pick an empty one, then we check previous slot, until we find a slot with an item.
	  Then we apply STEAL FORMULA for the item. (During the tests I managed to steal 2 poring cards 8)
	  If a mod doesn't have any slots then STEAL fails.
	- Possible exploit: If a mob (e.g. NEW MOBS) has only one rare drop, then STEAL would always try to steal that the only slot 8)
	  How to fix: I suggest to fill other empty slots with Jellopies or Apples with zero chance.
2005/10/01
	* Expanded NPC shop log info of sold items (cards, refine, etc) [Lupus]
	* Fixed compile errors in converters [celest]
	* Updating built-in zlib to 1.2.3 [celest]
	* Added unzip functions to grfio.c [celest]
	* Finished Fusion AF2 maps support - just put the .af2 files in the
	  afm folder and start the map server as usual [celest]
	  NOTE: It will need a new unzip library, so do 'make clean', or delete
	  'Makefile.cache' before recompiling!

2005/09/30
	* Updated the slave warp code. Now when a master recalls their slaves,
	  these will be placed 'randomly' around the master in an area_size/2 range.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up the mob link (supportive mode) code to prevent wasting time
	  trying to link friends every 100ms. Now the interval for linking friends is
	  MOB_MINLINKTIME (1 sec currently) [Skotlex]
	* Updated mob code so when a mob hits another, they set their 'attacked id'
	  to the mob in question, and not the mob's master. [Skotlex]
	* Some cleaning up of the Taekwon stance skills. Added a attack delay when
	  they trigger (same way as triple attack delays your continous attack) [Skotlex]
	* Modified the range check in skill_use_id/skill_use_pos so that if you try
	  to use a skill while moving, it will change your path to move one cell towards the
	  target before casting (as long as you are within one tile of being in
	  range). [Skotlex]
	* Moved the bleeding reduction formula to status_change_start, modified the
	  formula to be (lv/5+vit)% reduction. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the blind duration reduction formula. [Skotlex]
	* Upgraded Meteor Assault so you can specify the duration of
	  blind/stun/bleeding independently in skill_cast_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Made TK_JUMPKICK share the same code as Ashura Strike (just to see what
	  happens, both seem like they behave the same way, no?) [Skotlex]
2005/09/29
	* Some tweaks and fixes around status.c, may fix the timer mismatches of
	  status_change_timer. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a memory leak regarding pet status recovery scripts. [Skotlex]
	* Added timestamp support. Set timestamp_format to whatever you want, and
	  it will print a timestamp in said format before every Show* message. They
	  can be set independently for each server (defined at login_athena.conf,
	  char_athena.conf and map_athena.conf). Default is using no timestamps. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the new auth login system to take into consideration when the
	  client tries to connect before the character data arrives from the char
	  server. [Skotlex]
	  (seems to work well, but could use more testing)
	* Corrected the description of the 'skill_add_range' switches and made them
	  default to 5. Still pending further tuning (the official value of these
	  switches should have is still unknown) [Skotlex]
	* Added Demonstration to list of skills affected by
	  'gvg_traps_target_all' [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed Firepillar triggering multiple times when many characters
	  step unto it. [Skotlex]
	* Increased the damage delay randomizer to be +/-10% rather than +/-5%, may
	  fix 'stun-lock'. [Skotlex]
	* Added Consumable items log into pick_log [Lupus]
	- You can see logs when someone uses items (boxes, potions, etc)
	* Added AtCommands/CharCommands items deletion/creation log into pick_log [Lupus]
	* Removed some of the unnecessary verbose messages from the char server
	  during data saving. [Skotlex]
	* Added the new "online check" system (more of a fixing of a system that
	  was already there but was half working) [Skotlex]
	  it is turned on/off by using the online_check config options for the
	  login and char servers.
	- char server: When the check is on, players are kicked out of the char
	  server when their character is already online, and the map servers are
	  instructed to kick the account out as well. If there's no reply from the
	  map servers, the char is automatically set offline after 15 secs.
	- login server: When the check is on, players get "rejected from server"
	  when the account is online already, and afterwards the char servers are
	  told to kick that account out (like in the first case), if after 30 secs
	  there is no reply from the char servers logging off the account, the login
	  server sets it offline on it's  own.
	- The checks are by default on as they are meant to prevent possible
	  exploits on multi-map servers.
	- However, I have not figured out where exactly a char server gets to know
	  that a player has changed map-servers, so this could cause trouble in said
	  enviroments until I figure it out (it won't go out of sync forever since
	  the map servers do update their list of online characters every then
	  seconds) :/
	* Fixed crash, related to STEAL logs [Lupus]
	* Added TXT logs for Pick_log [Lupus]
2005/09/28
	* Added 'scripts items operations' and 'vending' into pick_log: [Lupus]
	  Tested with refine, getitem, getnameditem, removecards, etc commands. They are all supported.
	  Now you can see if a player breaks his armor in NPC Cards Remover, etc.
	  You can track down any item within a single DB.
	  You can make a SQL query to find which items are most popular, which quests are most popular, etc
	  Of course, it could help you to find your local items exploits, cheaters and unfail admins ^_-
	- Added 'Autolooted' and 'Stolen' items into pick_log
	- TODO: Add TXT logs
	* Fixed JobMaster NPC. Thanks Amada [Kayla]
	* Removed card-fix flag from Cart Termination. [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_check_target so that a mob will consither another mob an
	  enemy if either one has special mob ai (is a @summon or summoned alchemist
	  mob). Summons from the same master should not be attacking each other,
	  however I do think they will attack summons from another player. [Skotlex]
	* Removed 10 chances to pick an item from STEAL skill (it should have only 1 chance) [Lupus]
2005/09/27
	* Corrected again Wind Walk. Just +5 flee at lv10, walk bonus does not
	  stacks with other speed giving skills. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Wind Walk's walk and flee bonus (walk was a +4*skill_lv%
	  increase! and flee was +5 flee, rather than +5% flee of your total).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added atcommand @changeleader, transfers the leadership of a party to
	  someone else. [Skotlex]
	  (defaults as a GM-level 10 command, not quite yet tested)
	* Added delitem2 script command with script sample by Mihilion [Lupus]
	* Removed the check that prevented chars from logging out during status
	  changes, as the current system should save and restore these correctly.
	  [Skotlex]
2005/09/26
	* Fixed MAX GUILD capasity in mmo.h to allow correct +6 Guild Extension [Lupus]
	* Changed back the TIMER_MIN_INTERVAL to 50. Who changed it back to 25?
	  (svn3015 skotlex: Changed TIMER_MIN_INTERVAL to 25 (from 10), it probably needs to be bumped even higher, awaiting results from testers to see if a higher value would be needed.
	   svn1284 lupus: timers optimization / speed up / bug fix : no freezing mobs [TIMER_MIN_INTERVAL: 50->10])
	  (note to self: make this a setting in inter_athena.conf) [Skotlex]
	* Guild Extension now adds 6 per level. [Skotlex]
	* Added define ENABLE_SC_SAVING in common/mmo.h, comment/remove this line
	  to disable saving of status changes (temporary measure) [Skotlex]
	* Updated Double Casting to only work on Firebolt, Coldbolt and
	  Thunderbolt. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed cloaking/hiding. [Skotlex]
	* Updates to status_change_start, scdata loading now should display on the
	  targetted player. [Skotlex]
	* Removed card modifiers from Meteor Assault. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected skill_out_range_consume so that spells effectively fail if the
	  target goes out of range. [Skotlex]
	* Another another check on the new auth system which may help prevent
	  exploits. [Skotlex]
	* General cleanup and code improvements needed because of the new auth
	  system. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug in the new auth system (TXT) which was causing the gender to
	  be pretty much randomly sent. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug in changesex at the TXT char server level. [Skotlex]
	* Updated new logging system. Now logs TRADE, NPC Shops [Lupus]
	* Fixed a possible exploit in the new auth system. Thanks to End of Exam
	  for the information. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected True Sight critical bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Water Ball will now do the full number of hits regardless of available
	  water when used by non-players. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the emoticon delay to 1 second. [Skotlex]
	* Zeny/item kill bonuses now work on all skills, and not just physical
	  weapon attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Added official Ayothaya Town script by MasterOfMuppets [Lupus]
	* Added new Players / Monster Drops / Pickups Logging system [Lupus]
	- Changed new log table, now it has field 'type':
		M = Monsters Drop, P = Players Drop/Take, L = Mobs Loot Drop/Take, T = Players Trade Give/Take,
		V = Players Vending Sell/Take, S = Shop Sell/Take, N = NPC Give/Take
		NOTE: 'looted drop' might has cards, refine, etc. 'common drop' has item w/o cards/refine
	- Now you can see Players(cheaters) passing any items w/o trade
	- Now MOBS+PLAYERS drops come in the same table (easy to query)
		Poring -5 Apple
		Zelgadis +5 Apple
	- You can tell off monsters by their LOW id.  < 2000~ 
	- Negative value of AMOUNT shows that a mob, or a player has dropped that items amount
	- Positive value of AMOUNT shows that a player has pickedup that items amount
	- It works 5x faster than old DROPLOGS
	- TXT logs don't work yet
	- TODO: Add Autolooted & MVP items in the log, too.
	- TODO: Add Mobs Looters DROP items in the log. (Now only attacked mobs log loot drops)
	- TODO: Add Scripts/Vending logs

2005/09/25
	* Modified battle_weapon_delay so that additional status effects are
	  invoked even if the attack does no damage, as long as the attack connects
	  (that is, it is not a miss/lucky dodge) [Skotlex]
2005/09/24
	* Updated several mob stats for the Lighthalzen and later mobs from the
	  data provided by Viccious Pucca. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/mob_db.sql to contain the most recent mob_db. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for saving/loading status changes when characters log
	  in/out. [Skotlex]
	- TXT users: the file used by default is scdata.txt, can be changed by
	  setting scdata_txt to something else in inter_athena.txt.
	- SQL users the table used by default is sc_data, can be changed by setting
	  scdata_db to something else in inter_athena.txt. Use upgrade_svn3273.sql to
	  generate the new table.
	- It is currently unknown the behaviour of restoring some status changes,
	  if any anomality shows up, do report.
	- Currently, even thought the sc data is restored, the client does not
	  receives the packet telling them that the effect started (like Gloria, you
	  can see you have +30 luk, but the message is never there) nor the visual
	  effects are in neither. This is a side effect of starting the status
	  effects on a player before the client finished loading the maps and spawns
	  in the map. Will be fixed later.
	* Some memory optimizations tothe new auth system. [Skotlex]
	* Moved the charsave_method config to inter_athena.txt [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Demonstration/Bomb getting 100% breaking chance on low skill break
	  rates [Skotlex]
	* Fixed chars being able to cast skills while rooted if they didn't have at
	  least root lv1 [Skotlex]
	* Removed Assert in pet_walk, use a less unstable debugging tool, causes
	  errors in remote shells. [Kevin]
	* Fixed TXT char login with new auth system. [Kevin]
	* Done: Adjustable players titles for @who, @who2, @who3 commands [Lupus]
	- Check msg_athena.conf for new lines
2005/09/23
	* Software Caused Connection Abort errors will now cause said socket to be
	  removed inmediately from the listening list of sockets, this may help with
	  the lag issues that arise when said error occurs. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Demonstration having 100% breaking chance if you set skill breaking
	  chance to 0. [Skotlex]
	* Swapped functions of @who and @who3 commands. Because it's a spoil [Lupus]
	  to show players locations. You may enable @who for your common players now.
	  there's a shortcut for @WHO: @W
	* Started adding adjustable players titles for @who, etc commands [Lupus]
	- e.g. Super Player, GM, GM+, etc
2005/09/22
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to have the most current version. [Skotlex]
	* Finished first part of new auth system, fully tested. Will reduce char->map
	  lag by whatever it is you are haveing. [Kevin]
	* Added consideration of GrandDarkness in various code sections that were
	  only checking for Grand Cross [Skotlex]
	* Deployed use of map_getallusers all over the map server where it makes
	  sense to include disconnected players. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected map_getallusers to depend on the actual count of players in the
	  db rather than the variable users (prevents possible crashes if the two
	  differ) [Skotlex]
	* Updated the player counting function so that it correctly accounts for
	  all players (including those not connected like in autotrade) [Skotlex]
	* Characters will now automatically stand if Soul Drain is triggered while
	  sitting. [Skotlex]
	* Set default option gvg_traps_target_all: no [Lupus]
	- In kRO it used to be 'yes' some time ago but has been reverted back to 'no'
2005/09/21
	* Corrected an error in the way guild alliances were being counted, as
	  pointed out by Viccious Pucca. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed and deployed map_getallusers() on atcommands @who, @who2, @who3.
	  [Skotlex]
	- This function should enable the aforementioned commands to work even on
	  players who are in the server but are not connected (eg: autotrade
	  players). It is temporarily only deployed on the @who functions pending on
	  feedback (bug reports, anything) before going ahead and implementing it on
	  all relevant atcommand/charcommand/script functions.
	* Replaced the trim() function with Furoken's implementation (it should
	  remove tabs, consecutive spaces and other such unwanted characters from a
	  char's name) [Skotlex]
	* Updated doc/script_commands.txt to explain the upper parameter of the
	  function jobchange. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected sql query errors when logging trades and vending. [Skotlex]
	* Updated doc/script_commands.txt with the script commands I've modified
	  or added that are not yet described within. [Skotlex]
	* Small fix to clif.c which corrects characters that can't log in again if
	  they log out when the char and map server are not connected. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up all SQL error reporting. It now follows the same standard
	  everywhere, and is followed by a debug line which includes the file, line
	  number and contents of the attempted query which caused the error. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected an sql logs error when selecting a character with special
	  characters (eg: single quotes) on it. [Skotlex]
2005/09/20
	* Changed Palm Strike's initial animation display. [Skotlex]
	  (it will show as a normal attack that misses instead of an skill, but at
	  least the animation delay is correct and the skill can be chained now)
	* Adjusted Cart Revolution's damage to be based on the Cart's Max Weight
	  (instead of the hardcoded 8000w value) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a memory leak when pets cancel their casting. [Skotlex]
2005/09/19
	* Added error reporting an item in the item_db.txt file has insufficient
	  fields (rather than just crashing) [Skotlex]
	* Updated the item_db to use the new race and element constants. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed (I think) battle option muting_players. Defaulted it to yes. [Skotlex]
	* Added timers for displaying guildmates position. [Skotlex]
	- All the packet related code was already there by Valaris, so I wonder why
	  this wasn't finished before?
	* Added battle_athena options max_def/over_def_bonus (read
	  battle_athena.conf for desc) [Skotlex]
	* Added error reporting when the magreg file fails to be saved. [Skotlex]
	* Made berserk castable during the no-regen period when it expires. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a query error on sql refine logging. [Skotlex]
	* General checks to the script engine string management. Should fix a bunch
	  of memory leaks. [Skotlex]
2005/09/18
	* More updates to status change IDs [DracoRPG]
	* Implemented TK_SEVENWIND, allowed simultaneous use of several stances, thanks to
	  reddozen for all the info about that [DracoRPG]
	* Allowed to pickup/drop items while in Frenzy [DracoRPG]
2005/09/17
	* Added a check that should prevent fighting against other guilds outside
	  of WoE times. [Skotlex]
	* Hopefully fixed Hunter's Dectect skill. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the packet issues on the char txt server. [Skotlex]
	* Miscellanous corrections to skill_attack. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the AutoSpellWhenHit rate of all items in the db (TXT + SQL)
	  [Skotlex]
2005/09/16
	* Reverted some of the contents of skill_unit_move_unit_group since the
	  previous algorithm was optimized. Walking during a Song/Dance should be
	  smooth again. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the guild gm changing system. [Skotlex]
	- @changegm works now (tested in SQL, TXT should also be working)
	- Added script command "guildchangegm <guild id>,<new master's name>". Now
	  go write some Guild Master changing npc if you want it to cost money, have
	  a minimum guild level requirement, etc.
	* Added Ishizu's logarithmic drops equation. [Skotlex]
	  (see battle_athena.conf for full details)
	* Added a sub-function call to clear Castle owners when their guild is
	  broken. [Skotlex]
	* Added a char-server call to clear the alliance when a guild is broken
	  (when a guild breaks, the alliance/opposition is removed from memory on the
	  map server, so it seems said change is not sent/saved on the char-server
	  side?) [Skotlex]
	* Added script function sc_start4, starts an status change with all four
	  values. [Skotlex]
	  Use: sc_start4 TYPE, DURATION, VAL1, VAL2, VAL3, VAL4, <target ID>
	* Added SC_ARMOR_ELEMENT/SC_DefEle, specifies elemental defense bonus
	  against two elements at a time. For example:
	  sc_start4 SC_DefEle, 60000, Ele_Fire, 20, Ele_Wind, -15;
	  Gives 20% additional fire resistance and reduces 15% Wind resistance for
	  60 seconds.
	* Expanded battle_attr_fix to consider the status changes of the involved
	  chars that affect elemental modifiers. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some status effects not being correctly ended/recalculated when you
	  stepped out of quagmire/song/dances. [Skotlex]
	* Made quagmire be affected by the "gvg_traps_target_all" battle switch. [Skotlex]
	* Added Bloody Branch log (along with Dead Branch) [Lupus]
2005/09/15
	* The skill Vending will now fail on GM characters who do not satisfy the
	  gm_can_drop level requirement. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the sql-files mob_db.sql and item_db.sql files to the current
	  version (just feed'em to sql to have your item_db and mob_db tables
	  updated). [Skotlex]
	* Now @allskill and it's ilk will give you ALL skills except the ones
	  marked as "npc skills" (those have an inf2 value of 2). [Skotlex]
	* Some code optimization around song/dances, now the ensemble should be
	  cancelled if you walk (or are knocked out or whatever) out of it.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added log support to N slots. Now all cards should be logged [Skotlex]
	- Note that I have not been able to test it yet, so report back any
	  problems caused by it.
	* Fixed a memory leak when removing disconnected chars. [Skotlex]
	* Re-enabled the Memory Manager by default. [Skotlex]
	* Updated atcommand @rates so that it displays current exp rates in x form
	  (eg: "Current rates: Base 4.5x, Job 8.0x") as suggested by Mellowz.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Corrected resetskill messing up with Wedding Skills. [Skotlex]
	* Some adjustment to the status change defense (as per data provided by
	  Viccious Pucca) [Skotlex]
	* VVVS weapons now give +50 damage instead of +40 (again thanks to
	  Viccious) [Skotlex]
	* Success rate of making Star Crumbs now is 100% (regardless of skill
	  level?) [Skotlex]
	* Couple of crash fixes on the map-server char saving method
	  (char_save_method: 1) [Skotlex]
2005/09/14
	* Yet another correction to SQL char saving. [Skotlex]
	* Added support for N slots. [Skotlex]
	- By changing the constant MAX_SLOTS in common/mmo.h, the server can be
	  configured to support items with more than 4 slots. Saving/Loading and
	  inserting of cards should be working correctly. Features still missing
	  are including the extra slots in the log functions and updating clif.c to
	  send the extra cards to the client (This is still work in progress).
	- SQL Users interested in using this, need to manually add columns card4,
	  card5 and so on to the relevant tables (cart_inventory, guild_storage,
	  inventory, storage), example query:
	  ALTER TABLE inventory ADD COLUMN card4 int(11) NOT NULL default
	  '0' AFTER card3;
	- TXT users need do nothing, the char server handles the
	  expanding/contracting of slots internally (if the number of slots is
	  shrinked, the additional slotted cards are lost)
	- Never set the amount of slots to less than 4, as they are needed for
	  forged equipment.
	* Likely fixed Lex Divina. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed sql char-saving, too. [Skotlex]
	* Lex Divina can now be casted on allies as long as they are silenced.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed crashes on GVG grounds involving characters with no guild. [Skotlex]
	* Added a few socket features from Freya which hopefully will help
	  stabilize eA on Windows (testing needed!) [Skotlex]
	* Miscellanous fixes and rewrites to memitemdata_to_sql, it'll probably
	  fixed the stackable named items duplication exploit. [Skotlex]
	  (note that it is not tested, so there's the chance I broke everything
	  instead, so upgrade for testing purposes only and report back!)
	* Changed HP/SP drain rates so that the max (100%) is 1000. Adjusted item
	  db accordingly. [Skotlex]
	* Disabled chars from muting themselves (as a temporary measure against the
	  mysterious "don't use bot!" message) [Skotlex]
	* Added atcommand logging for /monster and /item (not quite tested yet, but
	  I think it'll work) [Skotlex]
	* Changed autospell rates so that the max (100%) is 1000. Adjusted item
	  database accordingly. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted displayed heal value. [Skotlex]
2005/09/13
	* Fixed Basilica [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the mechanics of how Devotion works. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Heal so that it displays on-screen the actual amount that was
	  healed. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the damage motion equation to 1/4th of what it was before (now
	  using player_damage_delay_rate: 100 is what was player_damage_delay_rate:
	  25 in previous revisions) [Skotlex]
	* The login servers will now notify when a player has an account ID under
	  700000 (which won't let them connect to the map server) [Skotlex]
	* Added support for SC_BLEEDING in skill_counter_additional_effect &
	  skill_additional_effect [Skotlex]
	* Changed bonuses bAtkRate, bWeaponAtkRate and bCritRate to modify
	  base+watk damage, not just watk. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected coma-effect killing bosses. [Skotlex]
2005/09/12
	* Party even share code won't try to give dead players their share of the
	  exp (since pc_gainexp would refuse so anyway) [Skotlex]
	* Added trim() usage to char servers to prevent creation of characters with
	  spaces at the beginning or end of name. [Skotlex]
	  (the client won't let me create chars with said names so I can't really
	  test it, but on the very least valid names are not crashing it as far as
	  I can see)
	* Expansion/optimization of the skill unit code. Now it should be correctly
	  identified when a character walks into a skill cell, walks out of a skill
	  cell, and walks out of the skill group (performance optimization,
	  client-side: songs and dance effects will work correctly, and Quagmire
	  won't spam "speed up/down" messages). [Skotlex]
	- Got basic testing only (casting, amp/encore, walking, being knocked back,
	  warping), so report any problems found.
	* Bomb/Demonstration should now be cast-able under the Emperium. [Skotlex]
	* Acid Terror now knows ignores armor defense, but not vit defense. [Skotlex]
	* Added an official Bards Job Quest (check npc\changelog.txt) [Lupus]
2005/09/11
	* Changed back the default of gx_all_hit to no. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to prevent ensemble skills from changing position. [Skotlex]
2005/09/10
	* Removed the changing of targets for offensive songs in gvg grounds. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Grand Cross not always hitting 3 times. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the display of Auto Counter. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to prevent auto-spells from being casted when the source and
	  target are the same (normally you can't hit yourself, though....) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Root [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the issue which made mobs do nothing. [Skotlex]
	* Change Provoke to affect armor def of mobs, and vit def of mobs/players. [Skotlex]
	* Another change to autocounter, I think it will work now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Defender's aspd bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed rooted character's root level (instead of using the caster's level) [Skotlex]
	* Windows builds will now abort and exit when there's a "Software Caused
	  Connection Abort" error since it seems unrecoverable.. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted back my char.c/sql char.c changes 8) Have to re-check [Lupus]
	* Added official Louyang city (thanks to MasterOfMuppets), fixed some Kafra bugs [Lupus]
	  check npc/changelog.txt
2005/09/09
	* Fixed TXT/SQL char servers not reading properly their command line arguments [Lupus]
	* Refixed those compiler errors >.< [Skotlex]
	* Readded the damage delay to firewall. [Skotlex]
	* Added an extra db (pc_db) to hold players, it should speed up map_id2sd
	  lookups. [Skotlex]
	  (note that all functions which do a search on all connected players do a
	  linear search on the connection sessions, and porting this to use the new
	  system will take a pretty annoyingly long time)
	* Added checks to prevent dropped items from stacking (they can still
	  stack, but at max 2 items per cell). [Skotlex]
	* Added Guild removing from memory upon guild break to Char SQL server
	  (TXT already had this correctly) [Skotlex]
	* Changed Provoke to reduce armor defense, not vit defense. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the direction check in Auto Counter. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the console functionality from socket.c (it was no good on the
	  map server since that session is used on disconnected players), also added
	  more checks to prevent parsing session 0. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to prevent skills from triggering auto-skills of the same id
	  (prevents unlimited chain-reactions) [Skotlex]
	* General fixes to guardian spawning code. [Skotlex]
	  (includes setting a timer so the Emperium gets it's guild data if not
	  available at spawn time).
	* When the Emperium's guild is not found (in mob_spawn_sub, 5 secs after
	  trying to spawn it) the Castle will be reset back to no guild owning. [Skotlex]
	* Fix to battle_check_target, should correct guardians/emperium [Skotlex]
	* Guardians will now be deleted if their guild is not found in
	  mob_spawn_guardian_sub. [Skotlex]
2005/09/08
	* Added filter into chat log. Check log_athena.conf for more info [Lupus]
	- Now you can turn off logs during WOE, etc
	* Made Musical Strike/Slinging Arrow work while in ensembles. [Skotlex]
	* Oops, fixed the compile error. [Skotlex]
	* Various checks to prevent trying to send data to disconnected players in
	  clif_send [Skotlex]
	* Moved the auto-spell code from weapon attacks to skill_additional_effect
	  and skill_counter_additional_effect. [Skotlex]
	- The autospells will trigger for all skills/normal-attacks except those
	  with nk =1 (no damage skill) which is needed to prevent stuff like
	  heal, traps or dances from triggering it.
	- Does not affect SC_HINDSIGHT triggered spells.
	- NOT properly tested as of yet, report any abnormalities and skills it
	  should/should-not be working with.
	* Fixed the crash when attempting to target a Emperium. [Skotlex]
	* mob_spawn_guardian will now 'retry' to load the guild data five seconds
	  later if the guild info is not available at spawn time. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed disconnected chars appearing as GMs on the console. [Skotlex]
	* clif_send_sub won't try to send any data to disconnected chars now. [Skotlex]
	  (may fix possible buffer overflow crashes)
2005/09/07
	* According to the patch, enabled Butterfly wings in the Castles [Lupus]
	* Adjusted MAX_GUILD constant according to Skotlex's changes [Lupus]
	* Now when the castle owner guild id is loaded, and the guild is not in
	  memory, the map server will request it right away from the char server. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Guild Extension to be +4 to the max guildmates per level. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default max vending value to 1 Billion [Skotlex]
	* Inverted meaning of pvp_noguild and pvp_noparty flags. the default then
	  for all maps where they are not set is: You can't attack parties/guildmates
	  on pvp maps. [Skotlex]
	* Updated mapflag/pvp_noparty to mark only the gvg arenas. [Skotlex]
	* Added mapflag/pvp_noguild, by default includes all pvp arenas. [Skotlex]
	* Cleared up some of the warning messages on mob_spawn_guardian. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the compile error on skill.c... [Skotlex]
	* Changed offensive song/dances target to BCT_ALL when invoked in pvp/gvg
	  grounds. [Skotlex]
	* Added unit flags UF_NOMOB, UF_NOPC to give better control on who gets
	  affected by ground skills [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the possible crash in map_foreachinpath. [Skotlex]
	* Removed the error message in mob_guardian_changeguild when the new guild
	  has ID 0, the mob will just be removed instead. [Skotlex]
2005/09/06
	* Changed Assumptio to target all players around target. Mobs are no longer
	  affected. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed battle_check_target fails on guild-mates in pvp maps. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted battle_check_target to prevent floras from hitting themselves
	  until a better scheme can be thought of. [Skotlex]
	* Reorganized battle_weapon_attack to allow counter/root from blocking
	  autotriggered skills (like TripleBlows/Sacrificial Ritual) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed that crash on mob_spawn_guardian. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle option gvg_traps_target_all, defaults to yes for now. [Skotlex]
	* Added Zoc's fix to @autotrade (which made traders unable to login again..
	  ever) [Skotlex]
	* Massive Guardian update. [Skotlex]
	- Rewrote the guardian stat-passing system to minimize the need of db
	  lookups. Should greatly reduce the heavy lagging during WoE.
	- Not properly tested (lack of resources), update at your own risk AND 
	  PLEASE report any crashes/problems.
2005/09/05
	* Fixed Endure. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Harmonic Lick not adding status change resistant. [Skotlex]
	* Moved ensemble stats calculating from status_change_start to
	  skill_unitsetting (performance purposes) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed song/dance effects lasting 30 secs rather than 20. [Skotlex]
	  (still somewhat inefficient, needs better handling method)
	* Battle check target fix: Novices/Low levels being unable to target mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Temporarily made traps not target allies on gvg (Still up for dabate) [Skotlex]
	* Battle check target update: Summoned creatures won't be checked versus
	  their master, means you should be able to target them as if they were
	  normal enemies. [Skotlex]
	* Made Shield Chain long ranged (it has to be affected by pneuma/defender). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed both trader/seller not being saved when using autotrade. [Skotlex]
	* Added debug messages to figure out who is causing the rain of function
	  mismatches on deleting skill_timerskill. [Skotlex]
2005/09/04
	* Fixed Trade Bug (when Trade Window indication was wrong). Thanks to k3dt
	* Now Water Ball isn't affected by RAIN mapflag anymore. Also corrected
		caclulation of number of WB shots (was broken by a typo) [Lupus]
		- Rain has been removed from kRO long ago.
	* Now Safety Wall fails to protect against Acid Terror. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config option firewall_hits_on_undead (defaults to 1) [Skotlex]
	  The deal is that each time the skill triggers on an undead, this number
	  of hits will be dealt instead of just one.
	  PROs: With a value of 5 or so, vertical firewall will work completely.
	  CONs: A high value means the whole tile can be wasted killing a single mob.
	* Fixed working stealing with NOLOOT mapflag on. Thanks 2Lorky [Lupus]
	* Now Knockback won't work when the target is already dead (prevents
	  ghosts) [Skotlex]
	* BSS now targets every player in the area of effect (might be updated to
	  include mobs pending on further information) [Skotlex]
	* Acid terror is now considered a ranged attack. [Skotlex]
	* Crash fixes to the npc-whisper system. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed classchange-able Emperium/Guardians/Treasure Boxes, thanks to alsimons [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed songs/dances, updated Hip Shaker [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed some fields in sql-files\main.sql... Who the hell added back `broken`? The field
	  `attribute` is the good one! Also changed `fame` type to the same as `zeny` (same max
	  value in the source code, so samemax value in the SQL saves !) [DracoRPG
	* battle_check_target update: Fixed BCT_NOENEMY checks. [Skotlex]
	* Moved Mental Sensing bonus from pc_gainexp to mob_damage, it is now a
	  status effect which the mob itself needs to be inflicted with to take
	  effect (and everyone involved in killing it will benefit) [Skotlex]
	* Pets now won't move while casting (unless their master is like a screen
	  away or so) [Skotlex]
2005/09/03
	* Fixed speed calc for pushcart/stalk/dancing/singing. [Skotlex]
	* Some crash-fixes introduced by the rewritten status system. [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted the default gvg penalty values, added gvg_flee_penalty. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed skill_blown causing a dangling pointer in the map data. [Skotlex]
	  (I believe this is the actual cause of all the crashes as of late)
	* Fixed @autotrade venders not being saved after they sell an item. [Skotlex]
	  Now both characters are saved to prevent exploits, too.
	* Fix to mob_setdelayspawn, if lucky might help with the crashes as of late. [Skotlex]
	* Added status effect SC_WATK_ELEMENT, converts part of your weapon attacks
	  into a different element. Used in magnum break to give 10% fire damage
	  bonus to your attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Made firewall hits not have any "damage delay", it merely knockbacks. [Skotlex]
	* battle_check_target update: added novice/low-level pk prevention on
	  pk_mode [Skotlex]
	* testing new SVN location [MouseJstr]
2005/09/01
	* Entirely rewrote status_calc_pc and status_get_[stat] functions to have a clear code.
	  They all use shared status_calc_[stat] functions to handle SC effects, this will avoid
	  to have 2 almost identical codes in different places for those effects [DracoRPG]
	  --> It compiles, it runs, it seems to work but I couldn't perform any extended testing
	      as always, feel free to report bugs ;)
	* Added battle_option "slaves_inherit_speed" to decide whether slaves have
	  or not the same walk speed as their master. Defaults to yes. [Skotlex]
	* Removed val4 from song/dances so that they won't be as bugged anymore.
	  (still pending on Draco's status update, but at least now stuff like Poem
	  of Bragi shouldn't cause insta-cast) [Skotlex]
	* Changed the way song/dance status effects last. The first time you step
	  in a tile the status starts for 30 secs, not refreshed until it times out.
	  Not the way it really should be, but it's much better for performance
	  issues.
	* Fixed summoned slaves having the same walk-speed as their master (fixes
	  metamorphosis-hatched mobs from having an egg's speed). [Skotlex]
	* Added fix_timer_heap, should correct timer problems when the tick
	  overflows. Does it works? We'll find out in 48 days when the next
	  loop occurs. [Skotlex]
	* Another update to battle_check_target [Skotlex]
	  (Should fix slave-skills hitting a slave's master)
	* Corrected magic_damage_return code being double-invoked. [Skotlex]
	* clif_GM_kick will now invoke map_quit if the player doesn't has a session [Skotlex]
	  (this should fix @kick and other such commands on autotrade chars and the
	  like)
	* Fixed pc_damage/mob_damage returning 0 instead of damage dealt (which in
	  turn made all attack/skills not trigger their additional effects) [Skotlex]
	* Updated Assumptio to target everyone instead of "not enemies" [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a fatal dangling pointer in the mob_setdelayspawn when handling
	  mobs that don't respawn. [Skotlex]
	* Updated WE_CALLPARENT to not check for range (as it should?) [Skotlex]
	* Added flag accreg_dirty to identify when account variables have not been
	  saved yet, it'll retry then on every call to save the character (it will
	  prevent account variables from being lost when the char/map connection is
	  not established)
2005/08/31
	* Updated @npctalk to work as it should [Skotlex]
	- Usage @npctalk NPC Name, Your Message Goes here
	* Fixed Wind Walk's flee/speed bonus (as pointed out by Viccious Pucca). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a crash in pc.c when the last save point was not found (thanks to
	  Foruken) [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote map_foreachinpath, it should work mostly right now. [Skotlex]
	  (the path 'stops' at the destination point rather than keep going
	  forward, but it can probably be fixed later)
	* Moved battle_config spawndelay adjustments from mob.c (calculating it
	  each time they were killed) to npc.c (calculate it once during parsing).
	  [Skotlex]
	* Synchronized additional status effects with the delayed damage [Skotlex]
	  (this should fix eg: enemies freezing when you start the attack
	  animation, and then breaking the ice when your attack animation finishes
	  and the damage shows up)
	* Moved knockback to effect after damage is applied. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the Wedding Skills not displaying the actual amount healed. [Skotlex]
	* Moved skill induced status effects to take effect before knock back. [Skotlex]
	* Refixed "Don't Forget Me" [Skotlex]
	* Changed 'pet_hair_style''s description and default value to 100 [Skotlex]
	  (100 is the value being reported to work with current clients)
	* Fixed Freeze 'counter' not resetting when killed. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Endure adding to mdef2 instead of mdef. [Skotlex]
08/30
	* Fixed Breaker's magical part of the damage having element -1 [Skotlex]
	  (now it takes neutral element, because I don't think the magical part of
	  an attack can get the weapon's property)
	* Fixed Magic Crasher having the min/max values inverted. [Skotlex]
	* Updated "Don't Forget Me"/"Slow Grace" to last 20 secs after you step out
	  of the dance-zone. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the default of defunit_noenemy to no, and added comments
	  explaining what it REALLY does. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed perfect tableture's lucky dodge bonus. [Skotlex]
	* Updated slave ai code to let slaves wander freely on the screen (will
	  wander as far as battle_config.view_area lets them) [Skotlex]
	* Splitted Char-sql status saving into status/status2, the later is for
	  values that will seldomly change. [Skotlex]
	* Updated servers so that when the player changes dye or hair color, the
	  char-server is notified and the guild_member data is updated on all map
	  servers. [Skotlex]
	* Updated servers so they also report on sex change. [Skotlex]
	  (altough this one I have no tested yet)
	* Changed bGetZenyNum/bAddZenyNum to be a bonus2 type [Skotlex]
	  (eg: bonus2 bGetZenyNum 10, 30 <- Receive 10z per mob level on 30% of
	  your weapon-based kills)
	* Added script function groupranditem(i), returns a random item_id from the
	  specified item-group given. [Skotlex]
	* Changed bLongAtkRate bonus to be more card-like (works just like
	  bLongAtkDef, except it's for attack) [Skotlex]
	* [SQL] Added Storage Items sorting by nameid. On loading. [Lupus]
	* Added GetItemInfo(Item ID,n) script function. Returns Buy/Sell Price, Def, etc [Lupus]
		added sample/getiteminfo.txt Tested, fully working!
	* Added ID#2258 Spiky Band(Sharp Headgear) to allowed equipment of Star Gladiator [Lupus]
	* According to the 23 Aug Patch added complete equipment check for 3 new classes. [Lupus]
		Now they can't equip forbidden items 8)
08/29
	* Added battle config option pet_hair_style and defaulted it to 24 [Skotlex]
	  According to information relayed by End of Exam, this should fix the new
	  clients showing the sword cursor for pets (older clients will be the ones
	  screwed instead, in said case you'll want to change pet_hair_style to 20)
	* Updated battle_check_target to take into consideration the special states
	  killer/killable. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the Fury Guardian Angel not giving +50 critical. [Skotlex]
	* Made mob_walktoxy fail when the mob is dead. [Skotlex]
	  (may fix the phantom mob issue?)
	* Updated spawn parsing to identify small/big mobs. [Skotlex]
	  Use the "event" field (last column, the one after the two spawn delays)
	  to identify the mob's size: 2: small mob, 4: big mob. 1-2 is not used
	  because a hella lot of plants/mobs already use 1 in it (even though eA
	  completely ignores this value)
	* Inverted the meaning of mapflags pvp_noparty/pvp_noguild [Skotlex]
	  When the flag is set, then you should NOT be able to hit your
	  party/guild-mates on pvp grounds.
08/28
	* Fixed demonstration/Bomb stacking. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed damage versus plants in BF_WEAPON attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the whole sqrtl mess. Thanks to Shinomori for clearing things up.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Added new maps, thanks to Poki#3 [DracoRPG]
	* Switched SCs between two taekwon kicks to get the proper icon ^^ [DracoRPG]
	* Added the falling animation to TK_HIGHJUMP, but now the client doesn't refresh the
	  position u_u [DracoRPG]
	* Reverted default option to allow anyone to plagiarize advanced skill (vicious or
	  someone else - I can't remember xD - told me it was like this on kRO, but not yet on
	  iRO) [DracoRPG]
08/27
	* Fixed the cast-bar from autocounter not disappearing after triggering the
	  skill. [Skotlex]
	* Updated battle_check_target to make marine spheres universal enemies, so
	  anyone can attack them. [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up item_db.txt (format, commas, etc), added status bonuses to the
	  cooked foods. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match with the current contents of
	  item_db.txt [Skotlex]
	  (sql users just feed it to mysql, it will drop and recreate the table)
	* Fixed IDs for Taekwon-class : 4047 is Star Gladiator, 4048 is a second Star Gladiator
	  (probably used for a "Superman-mode" flying sprite) and 4049 is Soul Linker [DracoRPG]
08/26
	* Fixed being able to move during Encore skills when you did not need a
	  partner. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @reloadmobdb not properly erasing mob skills before re-reading. [Skotlex]
	* Updated/fixed effect of most dances & songs according to kRO's website and ragnainfo's
	  very good Bard/Dancer Guide [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed Raging Trifecta Blows missing Emperiums, thanks to happylight [DracoRPG]
	* Changed the way short|long|magic_damage_return work : previously they gave 100% chance
	  to return x% damage, now it is x% chance to return 100% damage (Maya and High Orc Cards
	  should behave like this, I'm not sure for Orc Lord Card but it seems logical to be the
	  same system...) [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed bonuses from Wind Walker, thanks to vicious_puca [DracoRPG]
	* I also reorganized the hit/flee calc in status_calc_pc to consider first absolute values,
	  and then apply relative (percentage) modificators.. if you make a mix of both, it'll be
	  completely fucked up, and be sure it won't be like on officials (although my system maybe
	  isn't the good one neither...) [DracoRPG]
	* Some rewrites to client version rejecting code [Skotlex]
	  Should eliminate lag when players try to log-on with a rejected client,
	  however there's the chance they won't be receiving the "your client is
	  not latest EXE version" message, and that's why the previous, laggy,
	  implementation was used :/
	* Fixed Enchant Deadly Poison lasting forever after killed. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the duration argument of @summon [Skotlex]
	* Now @summoned mobs will follow their master everywhere and that includes
	  warping from map to map. [Skotlex]
	  (why? Because I think that's neat, and will probably be needed anyway
	  once Homonculus get implemented)
08/25
	* Cleaned up mob_db.txt and updated sql-files/mob_db.sql [Skotlex]
	  Sql users can just feed mysql the .sql file and it will delete and refill
	  the table with the most updated db data.
	* Corrections to damage versus plants. [Skotlex]
	  MAGIC and MISC attacks do 1 damage per hit.
	  WEAPON attacks do 1 damage, display miss if they hit multiple times.
	* Instead of knocking back (which wasn't even working), characters that are
	  stepping on an icewall will cause that tile of the icewall to 'die' [Skotlex]
	* Final damage equation update to Acid Demonstration. [Skotlex]
	  (it still won't ignore the raydric card, but why that is official in
	  itself is a big mystery)
	* Added status change for temporary boosts of stats, plus added the
	  following constants (db/const.txt): [Skotlex]
	  - SC_IncAll, SC_IncStr, SC_IncAgi, SC_IncVit, SC_IncInt, SC_IncDex,
	  SC_IncDex
	  - It hasn't been tested yet what kind of visual these will cause
	    client-side.
	  (Now someone go and write down the script for the food items xP)
	* Updated @summon to take a second parameter: duration. [Skotlex]
	  eg: "@summon lunatic 40" will summon a lunatic that lasts 40 mins or
	  until killed. Max duration is one hour.
	* Updated Some Mobs Spawns, Drops check npc\changelog.txt [Lupus]
	* Some toning down of the damage of Acid Demonstration (should /100, not
	  /10) [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed Blitzbeat from hitting neutral chars. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Acid Demonstration to be a MISC skill who's damage is (base_Atk *
	  caster's int * target's vit /10) (half that on players). It's much more
	  closer to official values than the previous ones... [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Pressure sapping SP even if you hide from it. [Skotlex]
	  (isn't Pressure a holy attack from the grand god himself? How can a thief
	  HIDE from his eyes? o.O)
	* Updated Acid Demonstration damage formula. It's still wrong, but at least
	  it considers int and vit now. [Skotlex]
	  Current dummy formula: (100 + caster's int + target's vit)*(number of hits)%
08/24
	* Updated pet skills database. [Skotlex]
	* Some corrections to socket.c, should stop all the recent crashing... [Skotlex]
	* Added a case to knockback enemies if they somehow end up stepping into an
	  ice wall tile [Skotlex]
	* Added checks to prevent walking, attacking or using skills while the
	  storage is open. [Skotlex]
	* Added Lupus's mob skills for Einbroch mobs [Skotlex]
	* (almost) rewrite of the storage system. [Skotlex]
	  Storages are marked dirty after an item is stored/retrieved from them and
	  will not be marked clean until the char-server acks the save request.
	  Upon map-server reconnection to the char, all storages that are currently
	  closed and dirty are saved.
	* Synched chrif_save with the storage save functions when either one is
	  open to further prevent exploits. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the mob_skill_db with Komurka's translation (Aegis -> eA) [Skotlex]
	  The max permilliage (rate) is now 10000 = 100%
	* Various mob related summon/metamorphosis changes: [Skotlex]
	  - Summon Mob/Slave's level is the total number of mobs to summon, when the
	  skill definition offers multiple mobs, they are spawned in order
	  (round-robin scheme).
	  - Metamorphosis/Transformation level is the total number of mobs to
	  multiply into. Uses the same criteria as summon mob and the original mob
	  is deleted/killed (no loot drop). If the level is 1, then the mob transforms
	  into one of the defined classes randomly.
	  - Note that beyond code-proofreading and making sure it compiles, this
	  has not been tested yet!
	* Added the bonus provided by the /doridori command to TK_HPTIME and TK_SPTIME. [Dralnu]
	  Thanks to Duduc.
	* Updated battle_check_target to check using the master instead of the
	  slaves (applies for mobs/pets) [Skotlex]
	  - Should prevent slaves from attacking their master
	* Implemented TK_HPTIME and TK_SPTIME exept the bonus provided by /doridori [Dralnu]
	* Implemented delayed character logout [Skotlex]
	  How it works: When a player quits the server when they shouldn't (force
	  disconnect before the 10 secs, or leave when the char server is not
	  connected) his session is closed, but the player is left in-game just
	  like in @autotrade, and a timer is added. Every 10 secs it'll check if
	  the char server is online, and then save the character and delete it from
	  the map server. NOT TESTED YET, so report any anomalies.
	* Fixed Shield Chain's skill-type (it's short ranged, not long?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Decrease Agility's equation. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed root'ed monks not being able to use root skills. [Skotlex]
	* Added inter-server option "kick_on_disconnect" (defaults to yes) [Skotlex]
	   - The only people who may want to change it are overcrowded servers where
	  the char/map server link breaks due to overload and then everyone is
	  kicked out until said connection is reestablished.
	  - Of course, use at your own discretion until all possible exploits
	  caused by this are resolved.
08/23
	* Fixed provoke's success chance. [Skotlex]
	* Battle_check_target update, should fix party/guild skills failing when
	  checking against yourself. [Skotlex]
	* Updated map and char servers to allow them to reconnect without having to
	  kick out all players. [Skotlex]
	  - This is still experimental and what possible exploits may come from it
	  are yet unknown (however, considering that the reconnection should take
	  place in a few seconds after the disconnection...)
	  - Note that storage contents and player contents are all kept in the map
	  server's memory, unsaved data will be lost if player forces a
	  disconnection, storage changes will also be lost if they are open/closed
	  during said disconnection (and NOT reclosed after the connection is
	  restablished)
	  - These and more stuff might come up with time. Report away!
	* Updated Gospel to not buff up Guildmates, only Party members. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @autotrade [Skotlex]
	  (tested on a limited scenario with few characters, needs more testing.
	  Test and report!)
	* Implemented TK_STORMKICK, TK_DOWNKICK, TK_COUNTER and TK_TURNKICK. [Dralnu]
	  Note that at the moment if you use theses skills even if the corresponding
	  SC is inactive, it will use SP and will stop you if you are attacking.
	  Note too that because we don't know how it should work exactly, when a SC such as
	  SC_STORMKICK will be launched, it will notice you by a little message over your 
	  head : Hit now !!.  Finaly, TK_TURNKICK will not yet have the pushback effect.
	* Fixed everyone having 20 flee... I hope. [Skotlex]
	* Some corrections and updates to mob skill Metamorphosis [Skotlex]
	  (don't know if it'll work now, but the way it was before definitely was
	  not working)
	* Probably fixed infinite endure wearing out when being hit. [Skotlex]
	* Updated gvg range penalties to be as in official servers. [Skotlex]
	  - Skills (weapon/magic/misc) get a 40% penalty
	  - Ranged normal attacks get a 20% penalty, melee receives no penatly.
	  (battle flag gvg_weapon_attack_rate added to complete configuration)
	* Added the -20 flee penalty on GVG grounds. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Enchant Deadly Poison's Damage (it was 500% - 5x at level 5, not 400%
	  - 4x) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Soul Breaker's magical part of the attack taking element -1 rather
	  than 0. [Skotlex]
	* Login sql server will now only clear sstatus data of connected servers
	  rather than clean the table. [Skotlex]
	* Added some checks to prevent infinite looping in the char servers. [Skotlex]
	* Some updates to the way disconnections are handled in socket.c [Skotlex]
08/22	
	* Fixed typo in skill.c causing errors [Codemaster]
	* Added Irmin's recommendation to allow item names in getitenname() [Skotlex]
	  (kinda odd to use an item's name to get the item's name, isn't it?)
	* Fixed Meteor Assault not displaying damage. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed WE_CALLPARENT crashing the map server when either parent is
	  offline. [Skotlex]
	* Added TK_HIGHJUMP. Note : To be able to see properly the full jump animation,
	  casting time will not depend on DEX. [Dralnu]
	* Somes fixes in skill_db.txt and skill_cast_db.txt about Taekwon's skills. [Dralnu]
	* Fully implemented the STR bonus part of TK_RUN [DracoRPG]
	* Added activation/unactivation of TK stances, but not their specific effects [DracoRPG]
	* Reverted magnum break, removed the Flame Launcher status change until
	  actual bonus can be implemented. [Skotlex]
	* Skills update (mostly thanks to Vicious Pucca): [Skotlex]
	  - Success chance and stats of Provoke, mental Break, Signum Crusis, Soul Burn
	  - Decrease Agility duration halved for players.
	  - Magnum Break's final damage is splitted 80% weapon's element, 20% fire
	    element. No longer causes weapon endow.
	  - Bash's hit bonus (+5 per lv now)
	* Fixed skill_db, Added perfect hit to TK_COUNTER [Dralnu]
	* Changed skill_tree and job_db1 the same way I changed job_db2, it was necessary for
	  clear implementation of Taekwon (which has a very unusual ID for a 1st job) and renders
	  the code less messy (at least it's my humble opinion ^^) although it could be slightly,
	  but really slightly, more RAM-consuming [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed classchange not clearing on unequip, fixed the mob's max hp not being updated on
	  class change [Skotlex]
	* Basic implementation of Taekwon's kicks. [Dralnu]
	* Likely fixed SP consumption of Warp Portal. [Skotlex]
	* Changed some default values in battle config to get the 'official gaming experience' by
	  default [DracoRPG]
	  - Noone can plagiarize advanced skills (from ragnainfo)
	  - No rare drop announce
	  - Riding a Peco does not increase one's size
	* Allowed Dispell to dispell songs/dances/ensembles [DracoRPG]
	* Updated SC IDs to get correct client-side status icons (used 0808 Sakexe) [DracoRPG]
	* Prevented from casting Ice Wall under self, independantly of UF_NOFOOTSET [DracoRPG]
	* Removed /omg from equipment breaking and added it to Acid Terror only [DracoRPG]
	* You can now change to Taekwon, but lots of things are still to do [DracoRPG]
	* Began implementation of Taekwon skills [DracoRPG]
08/21
	* Changed how triple blows/sacrificial ritual triggers to enable
	  plagiarizing them. [Skotlex]
	* Stolen items will be (un)identified using the same criteria normal drops
	  use. [Skotlex]
	* Updated yet again battle_check_target. Guardians should stop attacking
	  out of woe now and alchemist should be able to hit their mines. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the map server going in an infinite loop if the connection breaks
	  while parsing packets from the char server. [Skotlex]
	* Mostly rewrote Battle Chant, should be almost like the official one now... [DracoRPG]
	* Added enums for skill units, makes the code really clearer (check skill.h) [DracoRPG]
	* Merged battle_calc_weapon_attack_sub and battle_calc_weapon_attack [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed Acid Terror WEP breaking rate thx2 ShAPoNe [Lupus]
08/19
	* More updates to battle_check_target, now you can't target any
	  ground-based skills that don't have a physical manifestation (ie:
	  Everything except traps and icewall) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "for sure" battle_check_target when it comes to neutral targets. [Skotlex]
	* Removed pc_emotion, merged it with emotion. [Skotlex]
	  Usage: emotion emotion_number <, target>
	  - emotion number is the emotion's number (use e_* constants)
	  - target is 1-> player, 0-> npc. If ommited defaults to zero.
	* Updated code so that when a guild master joins the game, their guild
	  skills are automatically blocked for 5 minutes. [Skotlex]
	  (prevents avoiding the skill-lock by relogging)
	* Another update to battle_check_target, this time neutral targets should
	  work correctly (non allied/partied people who should be affected) [Skotlex]
	* More fixes to battle_check_target, skills should not hit yourself on
	  pvp/gvg now. [Skotlex]
	* Updated classchange to not change the class of bosses. [Skotlex]
	* Optimization/Fixes to battle_check_target, GrandCross should work now. [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Lupus's change on guild auras' max lv... Please double check your sources and
	  base yourself on kRO official website as much as possible, thanks. Link to kRO website:
	  http://guide.ragnarok.co.kr/GuildSystem.asp#ggg03 [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed passive mobs incorrectly setting the attacked_id when hit by pets. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote battle_check_target. [Skotlex]
	  - Positive side-effects: offensive stuff won't hit your guildmates on gvg
	  (such as traps)
	  - Negative side-effects: Unknown, but there's bound to be some because of
	  the big change. I tested it with traps, spells, pets, passive and
	  aggressive mobs, but it's probable there's stuff I am still missing.
	* Updated mob spawns of Glast Heim (gl_sew3 and gk_knt2) [Skotlex]
	* Updated classchange code (Azoth, Heiroloist) to get random classes the
	  same way a dead branch does. Cannot convert to bosses. [Skotlex]
	* Script/Npc/Item updates. [Skotlex]
	* Bonus b(HP/SP)GainValue will always be considered 100% (the first
	  parameter) this is done to avoid exploits when combining it with
	  b(HP/SP)DrainValue (eg: Immaterial Sword) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed max level of some guilds skills 5->1 [Lupus]
		according to http://eathena.deltaanime.net/board/index.php?showtopic=757 
	* New items drops, new shop [Lupus]
08/18
	* Changed the way 'pl' works (in skill_db) : now 0 for 'weapon' attack skills means the
	  attack is always neutral. To make so that the skill takes the weapon's element, use -1
	  instead: this removes the need of hardcoded ele_flag. [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed damage bonus from Sage's elemental flooring skills by moving the checks which were
	  totally wrong placed... Thanks to Antoine for pointing out they were broken. [DracoRPG]
	* At the same time I had to change battle_calc_magic_attack quite alot. Maybe it won't work
	  perfectly, but at least it'll compile. Also added (forgotten?) support for 'skillatk'
	  bonus with magic skills. [DracoRPG]
	* Rewritten most of Gloria Domini to make it be a BF_MISC skill that can hit and damage
	  Emperium and plants (yes it does), igonres WoE damage adjustments and other changes I
	  don't remember ^^ [DracoRPG]
	* Modified mob_skilluse so that mobs NEVER use offensive heal. They'll now
	  /swt if they try it (and the skill fails) [Skotlex]
	  (there's still nothing that can be done about offensive Sanctuary)
08/17
	* Added script command pc_emotion, works just like emotion, except the
	  emotion is displayed on the character that's running the script. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the vicious compile error I added with SC_SPEEDUP1 [DracoRPG]
	* Implemented Strengthen Guardians with a custom +10% ATK & ASPD / lv value [DracoRPG]
	  NOTE : It compiles, but I couldn't test the effect since guilds seem completely
	  broken on my test server...
	* Moved Weaponry Research hidden bonus a bit to get the exact effect [DracoRPG]
	* Implemented SC_SPEEDUP1 for Lightning Box effect [DracoRPG]
	* Entirely replaced SC_DIVINA with SC_SILENCE (the 1st was an alias of the 2nd) [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the map-server disconnecting the char-server when kicking out all
	  clients. (Thanks to End of Exam for pointing it out) [Skotlex]
	* Cleaned up error messages related to packet parsing in the char servers. [Skotlex]
08/16
	* Likely fixed the char-server crashes on mapif_send* functions. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed auto-counter's display (it was working correctly, however the skill
	  was not being shown properly on the client) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Tomahawk not being considered a ranged attack. [Skotlex]
08/15
	* Added a few bug fix recommendations [Codemaster]
	* Fixed a few problems with Wedding Skills [Codemaster]
	* Fixed a bug with old clients connecting and socket reuse which would kick
	  all new connections on the same socket before even checking the packet version. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the tabs in the ayothaya mobs :X [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the setsocketops error that was showing on every connection. [Skotlex]
	* Updated vending code so that items that can't be traded can't be vended
	  either. [Skotlex]
	* Messed with socket.c, changing lots of stuff around using some earlier
	  Freya SVN version as base, connection issues might hopefully get better. [Skotlex]
	  (NOTE: I have yet to try to compile this under Windows/Cygwin, so report
	  if it breaks)
	* Updated Magnum Break: Target selectable, damage is (100+20*level)%, hit
	  bonus +10 per level. 5x5 splash area. [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the max hp display of tiny/big mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Cloaking. It'll fail if the level is less than 3 and there's not
	  a wall nearby. [Skotlex]
	  If cloak_check is set to ignore walls, the wall-type speed will be used all
	  the time.
	  (I don't see what all the fuss is about as a Lv2 Cloak is just as good as
	  Hide, and you can't even use GrimTooth from it. And since lv2 won't let
	  you move anyway, why would anyone use Clock lv2 over Hiding?)
	* Updated Assumptio. It will affect anyone in a 3x3 area around the target. [Skotlex]
	  (where anyone is anyone the same way Benedictio chooses it's target)
	* Updated the delay that a mob can't move after attacking to be 1/4th of
	  the delay between attacks. [Skotlex]
	  eg: The mob attacks once every 1000ms, that means it can start chasing
	  you 250ms after an attack.
	* Likely fixed the #fakename crash. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the mob skill use code so that hopefully other players will be
	  considered friends when using support skills. [Skotlex]
	  NOTE: Not quite tested, use with care.
	* Fixed @monsterbig/@monstersmall [Skotlex]
	  Support for said monster in normal spawn scripts is also fixed, however
	  the implementation is not stable (currently you add 10K to the ID to make
	  it a tiny mob, add 20K to make it a big mob, but those values depend on
	  MAX_MOB_DB which can change in the future. :/)
	* When you drink a speed potion, the icon of the previous one will be
	  removed (however, all speed potions are still in effect server-side). [Skotlex]
08/14
	* Likely corrected the error printing in recv_to_fifo (reporting normal
	  disconnections when they likely are not). [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the map-server spamming "Client does not has latest EXE message. [Skotlex]
	* Updated char-sql to consider 0 an invalid map-server session number. [Skotlex]
	* Fix in map->char auth request packet where char server spams data search error message, currently in testing. But works none the less. [Kevin]
	* Removed all close()'s in clif.c, made clif_parse the only one who closes
	  a socket and deletes the session. [Skotlex]
	* Updated socket.c to be much more verbose about connections and when they
	  are ended. [Skotlex]
	  (excuse all the extra messages, but they are to help track down the
	  current map-freeze bug)
08/12
	* Updated sql-files: mob_db.sql, item_db,sql, main.sql [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed mob reloading command. [Skotlex]
	* Added more reports and some fixes/optimizations to socket.c [Skotlex]
	* Added reporting of error when a connection can't be made non-blocking. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Logging Filter: [Lupus]
		- Implemented refine_items_log condition. You may log only certain refine value items.
		- Added 'log_steal' option. It'd log stolen items in the drops log DB
	* Added msg string and announce on stealing of rare items [Lupus]
08/11
	* Fixed bio-cannibalize's max hp issue. [Skotlex]
	* Pneuma completely blocks Soul Breaker (as the forum consensus says it
	  does so) [Skotlex]
	* clif_parse will now print the error message in case close(fd) fails. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed players clicking on players disguised as NPCs trying to execute the
	  "npc". [Skotlex]
	* Fixed possible overflows and exploits in log.c, thanks to Irmin [Skotlex]
	* Probably fixed devotion's visual not updating. [Skotlex]
	* Added flag pet_no_gvg, when set to yes/1 the pet is returned to an egg when
	  you enter Guild Grounds and you aren't allowed to hatch pets as well. Note
	  that it only does the check when the player changes maps (should be safe
	  because players are kicked out of castles when WoE starts)
08/10
	* Fixed PNEUMA blocking magic part of Soul Breaker, instead of physiacal attack one [Lupus]
	* Fixed the Login/Char SQL crashing when determining the max id of empty
	  tables. [Skotlex]
	  Account and Char creation code tested, it is safe to use now.
	* Removed use of settick_timer (fixes the "can't move!" bug) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed (I think) being able to sit while casting. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Char-SQL server to guarantee that new chars are created with
	  char_ids above 150K. [Skotlex]
	  (note from last update applies too)
	* Updated Login-SQL server to guarantee that new accounts (_M/_F reg) are
	  created with account_ids above 2M. [Skotlex]
	  (note it hasn't been tested yet, but I think it should work)
	* Fixed @readmail 0 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed success rates for Dispell and Decrease Agility [Skotlex]
	* Fixed cultivation not being in the list of skills for GMs with
	  gm_skill_all [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob's hp becoming zero after mob_hp_rate adjustments. [Skotlex]
	* Skills update: [Skotlex]
	- Changed concentration from +10% hit per level to +10 hit per level.
	- Base level gives greater stun chance to Attack Weak Point (currently +1%
	  every ten levels)
	- Changed Tiger Knuckle Fist to be a combo-only skill.
	- Updated Spell break to damage 2% of target's max hp, heals half that.
	* Small debug change in clif.c which forces a disconnection upon dual-login [Skotlex]
	* Updated char-sql deletion to take into consideration the mysql version [Skotlex]
	  It should treat versions 4.1+ differently from the rest, please test and
	  report if it is still failing.
	* Removed sql loading of storage every time you open it as it's an open
	  exploit on lagging servers. [Skotlex]
	* Removed another "insufficient data" debug line. That should take care of
	  incomplete packets spamming the console. [Skotlex]
	* Alright, removed the "insufficient data" debug line as it was just
	  causing mass lag. [Skotlex]
08/09
	* Fixed Magnum Break's damage display. [Skotlex]
	* Finished fixing and testing the sql char deletion update. [Skotlex]
	  Deleted characters should now properly leave their party/guild.
	* Throw Stone is now blocked by Kyrie and Pneuma [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "[error] delete_timer error: no such timer -1" (stupid mistake x.x) [Skotlex]
	* Some modifications to char-sql char deletion, so that characters are
	  correctly removed from parties and guilds. [Skotlex]
	  (Note that this is yet to be tested, so upgrade at your own risk or if
	  you want to help file bug reports until I can get to test it on my own
	  later today)
	* Likely fixed Endure and the like not being 'disabled' on GvG grounds. [Skotlex]
	* More debug messages to clif.c (these can be ignored on normal situations,
	  but might be useful during freezes) [Skotlex]
	* Optimized the packet-version failed rejecting code. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Freezer Card combo casting Weapon Perfection on the enemy. [Skotlex]
	* Added more information to the map-char connection process, meant to help
	  understand what is going on when things 'freeze'. [Skotlex]
08/08
	* Fixed players not really being disconnected when the char-server is out. [Skotlex]
	* Added check to resend map server connection packets if the connection to
	  the char server was established but the initial packets get somehow lost. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Picky's pet-script being used for all pets... [Skotlex]
	* Fixed an ugly bug that was causing status-changes to crash the map server [Skotlex]
	* Added a timer to the map server. It'll try to reconnect 1 sec after it is
	  disconnected from the char server (in addition to the default "try to
	  connect every 10 secs" mechanism). [Skotlex]
	* Reverted Safety Wall to last known working state. [Skotlex]
	  (from what I read in the code, it should be crash-safe anyway)
	* Mob level up is now capped to max_base_level rather than 99. [Skotlex]
	* Another fix to Safety Wall :X [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Safety Wall (I think). Do test and pray it crashes no more. [Skotlex]
	* Added settick_timer to timer.c, optimizes status retimings for dance
	  skills. [Skotlex]
	* Made @autoloot and item_auto_get play along nicely (@autoloot toggles the
	  mode, item_auto_get sets the default state of it) [Skotlex]

08/07
	* Corrected the Payon Guild Flags [Codemaster]
	* Lots of debug message cleanup in clif.c which should make more clear the
	  why characters are being disconnected. [Skotlex]
	* Added OnAgitInit to the list of npc events executed on connection (it
	  will be executed only the first time it connects, thought) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the exp bonus on pvp maps (it was set to +115%, not +15%) [Skotlex]
	* Updated skill_blown to avoid knocking back plants. [Skotlex]
	* Made the damage delay of the finishing blow the same delay before sending
	  a char clear packet, this might fix mob sprites being left there after
	  killed. [Skotlex]
	* More fixes to @autotrade
		(You still can't disconnect your autotrader by entering in the
		server again. And an autotrader rises map server usage to 70%+).
		 Started adding Freya's anti-bot thing [Lupus]
	* Quick fix meant to prevent crashes when targetting "ghosts" of already
	  dead mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Pneuma and Safety Wall crashing the server. [Skotlex]
	  (was caused by yesterday's skill upgrade not being... eh, complete)
08/06
	* Yet another @autotrade fix by irmin&Ultra. More fixes are coming soon 8)) [Lupus]
	* Pretty big change in the way ground skills are handled, meant to fix
	  possible segmentation faults. [Skotlex]
	  Report if you notice any ground skill got broken, as pretty much all of
	  them have been affected. 
	* Removed the data about packet_version 14 in the packet_db [Skotlex]
	  This could mean that version 14 never really existed, and all following
	  versions need to be shifted up (who decides how to call these versions?
	  they certainly don't come coded in the login packet. We should ask
	  Sara-chan, the awesome ex-eA dev who pwns us al with her packet finding abilities.). 
	  Note that no such changes have yet been decided other than removing version 14.
	* Updated Devotion/Sacrifice. AutoGuard and Defender skills are now kept in sync
	  between the Crusader and those Devoted. [Skotlex]
	* Added a battle_stopwalking to NPC_STOP effect [DracoRPG]
08/05
	* A li'l fix of @autotrade. Used some irmin's code and optimized a bit [Lupus]
	* Fixed pc_setcart... [Skotlex]
	* Updated Fireball and Stone Curse data [Skotlex]
	  Source used: http://guide.ragnarok.co.kr/jobmagskill.asp
	* Updated map_server sql so that the storage is loaded from sql everytime [Skotlex]
	* Updated the char deletion routine (sql) so that only the correct pets
	  will be deleted (those hatched and that are in the char's inventory/cart)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the map server spamming the console when clients gets
	  rejected due to packet version. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the make_connection problem (sorry about that) [Skotlex]
	* Updated make_connection (socket.c) so that it actually returns -1 when
	  the connection fails. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed change-cart clearing other options. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed @spawn not working with string names. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed songs/dances not being moved when knocked back. [Skotlex]
08/04
	* Made mobs retaliate against a pet's master when for some reason a pet is
	  attacking a passive mob which is not yet attacking back. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the mob_db to make it a dynamic array of mob databases. [Skotlex]
	  This allows usage of high mob ids without wasting memory on large gaps of
	  unused mob IDS.
	  NOTE: Other than loading/unloading the map server, this has not
	  been tested, if it crashes DO report right away (preferrably with a
	  backtrace)
	* Bumped the MAX MOB ID to 10K [Skotlex] 
	* Added 2 new mobs, updated and added some items. Thanks to Landarma [Lupus]
	  Also fixed map-serv loading warnings (about wrong mob IDs)
08/03
	* Removed the clif_waitclose timer message, and placed it instead around
	  clif.c on the areas that are actually invoking the waitclose timer. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the "Player not identified with account id" message to be more
	  descriptive (however I don't know how much of the player data is available
	  when disconnecting this way, so if it crashes DO REPORT it) [Skotlex]
	* Modified @me so that it actually works as expected by IRC junkies. [Skotlex]
	  (tested and works correctly)
	* Updated Enchant Deadly Poison: Can't be dispelled, won't end when you are killed. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed draining more HP/SP than you can have [Skotlex]
	* Fixed enchanted peach tree damaging you when attacking the undead [Skotlex]
	* Removed the tick check from the packet_version guessing as it is an
	  unsigned int (so every value in said field is valid) [Skotlex]
08/02
	* The char server now notifies the map server about which is the max
	  account/char id available, this is used to help identify packet versions
	  more reliably. [Skotlex]
	* Guardians won't level up now with mobs_level_up=1 [Skotlex]
	* Updated Deluge, Volcano, Violent Gale & Land Protector to not require
	  gems when recasted, and the previous time remaining will be used instead.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Zeny from mobs. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the visual effect when pets heal status ailments to "Detoxify" [Skotlex]
	* Fixed "bonus2 bSkillAtk" so that it works with up to five skills [Skotlex]
	  (previously it only worked for one skill at a time)
	* Fixed Enchant Deadly Poison on normal attacks. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the packet-guessing code, trying to load negative char accounts
	  should be fixed now. [Skotlex]
08/01
	* Updated the login servers so that account registration can be done with
	  _m/_f as well as _M/_F [Skotlex]
	* Fixed login sql server not using md5sum on the passwords before creating
	  accounts (when md5 passwords are enabled) [Skotlex]
	* Updated Enchant Deadly Poison: Increases Sonic Blow's damage by 4x and
	  affects all skills except Breaker/Meteor Assault [Skotlex]
	* Added a check to prevent char-server freezes when receiving unknown
	  packets from the map server. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some problems with the clif optimizations from earlier today (wrong
	  animations being displayed for normal attacks/picking items) [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote Ensemble skill implementation to be more efficient and less
	  error-prone [Skotlex]
	  (say, when you do an ensemble skill, your partner has to be
	  charged SP too? That is not the current case)
	* Dance/Song checks so that the ground effect is more tightly coupled with
	  the status effect (if the dance's effect is cancelled for whatever reason,
	  the ground skill WILL be removed) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed stat reset for Advanced Classes [Skotlex]
	* Updated Lord Knight's Concentration (damage, defense, endure effect) [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed famous alchemist potion usage. [Skotlex]
	* Small optimization to the packet version guessing code. [Skotlex]
	* Added Warpparty and Warpguild script commands *requested* [Fredzilla]
	* Fixed the exp exploit bug dealing with expaddrace [Skotlex]
	* Added missing CharCommands logs (together with ATCommands) [Lupus]
		TODO: '/' commands 8)
	* Added mod for npc whisper system(lordalpha)[massdriller]
	* Added lordalfa's str1 and str2 compare and check commands [massdriller]
07/31
	* Fixed (I think) the char sql server freezing when the map server sends it
	  a GM whisper request. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the way that experience is given, this should prevent exp overflows
	  even in even-share parties. [Skotlex]
	* Changed how the exp_calc_type works, take note that there's no longer a "2"
	  value for it! [Skotlex]
	* Updated throw stone: Damage is modified by target's cards, 3% chance to
	  cause Stun/Blind. [Skotlex]
	* Added rods/books to the list of items that can't break. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed map server rejecting clients of packet versions 9 and below
	  (regardless of packet_ver_flag) [Skotlex]
	* Updated Steel Body: Consumes 50% sp and is not dispellable. [Skotlex]
	* Updated sprinkle sand's damage to 130%, Throw Stone's range and delay [Skotlex]
	* Fixed increased dodge's flee bonus and speed bonus (to Assassins). [Skotlex]
	* Simplified clif.c by removing all code related to hard-coded packet
	  information (the packet_db.txt is an essential file now) [Skotlex]
	* Small fixes to provide clarity to # commands 
	(So many people ask "why doesnt @char????? work, like OMGWTFBBQ") [Fredzilla]
	* Fixed a stupid typo in a drop rate display [Lupus]
07/30
	* Some more fixes to the job calculating equations. This one should fix item
	  usage for mounted classes and hopefully be the last fix needed regarding
	  the job system upgrade. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the parsing/reading of the skill tree. This fixes the Priest/Monk
	 skills appearing in the skill trees of Paladings/Crusaders. [Skotlex]
	* Another fix about advanced/baby mounted characters not having skills. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed character's class not getting updated when mounting/dismounting peco. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the default packet version checking in the guessing version code.
	  as pointed out by End of Exam. [Skotlex]
	* Optimized the code that determines what packet version to use by default
	  when you specify "packet_db_ver: default" [Skotlex]
	* Fixed job changing to high/baby classes [Skotlex]
07/29
	* Moved messages "One Castle", "Two Castles", etc into msg_athena.conf [Lupus]
	* Fixed wrong msg_athena.conf messages in the trade hack spoof code [Lupus]
	* Added a Rare Item announce string into msg_athena.conf [Lupus]
	* Fixed compilation of the TXT server. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed song/dances not clearing when you run out of SP [Skotlex]
	* Fixed #fakename [Skotlex]
	* Optimized Apple of Idun's implementation [Skotlex]
	* Updated pc_calc_base_job and related functions and applied them around
	  the map server. This should fix all item related problems with Super Babies
	  and alike. [Skotlex]
	* Simplified/optimized the code that mounts/dismounts from Pecos. [Skotlex]
	* Changed Create Deadly Poison to not use the item producing interface (works simplier,
	  like Aqua Benedicta) and added a separate config option to choose whether the maker's
	  name is written on the Poison Bottle [DracoRPG]
	* Changed NPC_STOP to immobilize the target during 2 seconds (from ragnainfo) [DracoRPG]
	* Added "cartboost" state to skill_require_db (used for Cart Termination) [DracoRPG]
	* Rewrote Soul Destroyer's damage dealing and displaying code, now everything is done at
	  once: no more people killed without damage displayed [DracoRPG]
	* Readded Assassin Cross not affecting bows [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Hip-Shaker (not tested, but I am assuming it works now) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Brandish spear's damage [Skotlex]
	* Removed the after-cast delay of Recall Partner [Skotlex]
	* Added optional announce of rare drops. When a SomePlayer kills a monster [Lupus]
	  with a rare drop then everyone gets announce: 'SomePlayer' won Pupa's Pupa Card (chance 0.01%)
07/28
	* Fixed the Server Whisper to GMs in the char-sql server [Skotlex]
	  (when an exploit that should be notified to GMs is triggered, the map
	  server would just hang instead...)
	* Some code reorganization around the name-spoof exploit protection code. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed not being able to do Extremity Fist after Glacier Fist/Tiger
	  Knuckle Fist [Skotlex]
	* Likely fixed the Famous Alchemist potions not having that 50% boost. [Skotlex]
	* Updated the Wedding Skills (they work with 10% HP/SP and heal 10% of
	  their target's, summoning has a cast time of 20s) [Skotlex]
	* Reverted AssassinCross's song behaviour. [Skotlex]
	* Odd bug wanting all Account and Char IDs to end with 0?! [Codemaster]
	  Note: Not all acc or char ids end with 0...this gave alot of problems with client version 16
	* Fixed that compiling issue with buildin_getequippercentrefinery [Skotlex]
	* Updated Bard's AssasinCross (Impressing Riff) to not affect Bows (is this
	  how it really is?) [Skotlex]
	* Massive skills update (from now updated kRO website) [DracoRPG]
	  - Weapon forging, ore/metals refining, potion making : tried to correct rates ^^
	  - Weaponry Research : does NOT increase NPC equipment upgrading chance
	  - Skin Tempering : (4*skilllv)% fire resistance and (1*skilllv)% neutral resistance
	  - Hilt Binding : the original 'undropable weapon' part is dead
	  - Meteor Storm : (3*skilllv)% stun chance
	  - Lord of Vermilion : (4*skilllv)% blind chance
	  - Sandman : (40+10*skilllv)% sleep chance
	  - Ankle Snare : minimum trap time changed to (3+0.03*skill_lv) seconds
	  Tons of other skills could and should be reviewed the same way ! ^^
	* Fixed massdriller's fixes ^_^ [Kevin]
	* Some fixes to Whisper system. [massdriller]
07/27
	* Fixed the fame list packet mismatch bug. [Skotlex]
	* Even more cleanups to socket.c and chrif.c to prevent even handling
	  Session #0 [Skotlex]
	* Some more cleanups to chrif.c (the interface to the char server)'s code. [Skotlex]
	* Appied End of Exam's socket/connection related fixes/suggestions. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a Segmentation Fault with friends list loading. [Kevin]
	* Fixed the npc whisper system. [Kevin]
	* Fixed most of the matrix bug, note to devs: Don't use tmp_output anymore! [Kevin]
	* Fixed a small compile warning with previous fix. [Kevin]
	* Added ATCommand @AutoTrade. You open a shop, setup your goods. Then use @AUTOTRADE.
	  Your will be closed, but your merchant would remain in the game. So you can vending
	  without your client ON. (originally by Fantik, changed by Lupus)
	* Added ATCommand @ChangeGM. Your Guild Master can set another GM of the guild.
	  Note: It works, but have to be optimized, WIP. (originally by Fantik, changed by Lupus)
	* Added lordalfa's npc whisper system [massdriller]
	* added lordalfa's fix/enhancement for Execute Scripts::labels [massdriller]
07/26
	* Updated the packet-version guessing code, hopefully it does a better job now [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the mob bug where they "stick to you" and won't let you escape [Skotlex]
	* Reverted mob skill usage rates. A rate of 1000 (in mob_skill_db.txt) IS 100% usage. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Gospel not dissipating when you die. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Providence/Resistant soul so it can't be casted on yourself-other crusaders [Skotlex]
	* Updated Quagmire to affect everyone in GVG maps. [Skotlex]
	* Small fix to the packet_version identification [Skotlex]
	  A more complete testing/verification code comes later...
	* Likely fixed the txt->sql converter. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected some refine success rates. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the packet client version guessing code (perhaps it more
	  accurately guesses the version now?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed reading of 'repairitem' packet in packet_db -> fixes Weapon Repair [DracoRPG]
	* Rewrote Weapon Repair to allow use on other players [DracoRPG]
	* Moved pc_item_repair, pc_item_refine and pc_item_identify to skill.c [DracoRPG]
07/24
	* Enchant Deadly Potion now does count card modifiers. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed elemental modifiers not applying to skills. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob_ghostring_fix config. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed firewall stun-locking enemies that are not pushed back. [Skotlex]
	* Added some checks into MONSTER spawn command (reports wrong number, ID, delays, etc.) [Lupus]
	  - somehow it doesn't report about wrong map names yet
	* Added check for missing TAB characters into script parser [Lupus]
07/23
	* Fixed friend-saving on the new charsave sql method. [Skotlex]
	* Corrected the ghostfix description in battle_athena. [Skotlex]
	* Modified the Makefile to include FD_SETSIZE = 4096 when compiled under
	  Cygwin [Skotlex]
	* Added a check for max mob skill level (when reading mob_skill db) [Lupus]
	* More fixes/updates to the txt->sql converter of inventory/cart (will it ever work?) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed job_db2 reading [Sasuke]
	  Field count is MAX_LEVEL+1 since job ID is the first field of the 'split' table
07/22
	* Changed a bit the aspd penalty for dual-wielding assassins. [Skotlex]
	  The new factor is 2/3 rather than 0.7, which should be closer to what
	  rodatazone says, but also makes them dual wielders a bit slower :X
	* Fixed job_db2.txt reading so that it will read up to MAX_LEVEL job bonuses. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the way the OS is detected in socket.h [Skotlex]
	  This MIGHT fix the current 60 user limit problem.
	* Fixed characters not being able to attack and getting "there is a delay
	  after a skill" messages instead. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed status changing cards not taking effect. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed packet_ver_flag reading. [Skotlex]
	  (previously, if you tried setting it to 256 or 512 it would be
	  resetted back to 255, which would cause problems with the later clients)
	* More fixes to the txt->sql converter. Does it works now? [Skotlex]
	* Added water height values of Ayothaya, Ayo_dun02, sec_in02 maps (thanx 2Lorky) [Lupus]
	* Fixed char-sql memo saving. [Skotlex]
	* Added the wantoconnection packet of version 13 to version 14 [Skotlex]
	  Note that this will cause all ver13 clients to be identified as v14, it
	  WILL cause problems if you use ver13 clients. There is no easy way around
	  this as both versions seem to use the identical login packet. If you
	  want to give preference to v13 over v14, you can specify the default to
	  be it.
	* Fixed Encore skills working when the partner has no weapon equipped. [Skotlex]
07/21
	* Fixed the fame lists, they work now. [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the friends system, it now works. [Skotlex]
	  Sql users upgrade with the 2574.sql upgrade, txt users will have to
	  wipe their friends.txt (there's no easy way to convert that one).
	* Fixed the txt->sql converter not converting inventory/card. [Skotlex]
	  The friend conversion was removed due to the new structure.
	* Restructured some of the logic behind auto-attacks and normal attacks
	  which should prevent most speed-hacks and be more responsive to players. [Skotlex]
07/20
	* Updated the txt->sql converter, I THINK it will work now. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Plagiarized skill's level not being saved. [Skotlex]
	* Changed Pressure/Gloria Domini to take a % of current SP, not max SP (from a post on
	  ragnainfo, not personal custom shit! :p) [DracoRPG]
	* Removed debug messages for fame list and signaled the bug that causes problems [DracoRPG]
	* Removed the need of job_db2-2 (advanced jobs' stat bonuses) and moved its use to
	  job_db2 [DracoRPG]
07/19
	* Reorganized the way sql chars are being saved. [Skotlex]
	* Merged battle options player_combo_damage_delay and
	  mob_combo_damage_delay into combo_damage_delay [Skotlex]
	* Some code reorganization that hopefully should help with mobs not having
	  the same damage delay on the client and within the server. [Skotlex]
	* corrected some bounds errors in the new packet_db code 
	  that was corrupting memory [MouseJstr]
	* Corrections to Tiger Knuckle Fist [Skotlex]
	* Rewriting of part of the skill-additional effect code. (Should fix
	  Asura's penalty) [Skotlex]
07/18
	* Added a check that might prevent sql char crashes when requesting info
	  for non-existant Characters. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed main.sql (start char_id should be 150k) [Skotlex]
	* Some code-cleaning for Sacrificial Ritual [Skotlex]
	* Optimization of auto-triggering skills (double attack, sacrifice, triple
	  blows) [Skotlex]
	* Small fix to Sanctuary (shouldn't start healing until after 1.5 secs of
	  casted) [Skotlex]
	* Implemented Palm Strike (you cast the skill, it pushes back the enemy and
	  deals damage 1 sec after it was casted) [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote and tested Gospel's code, currently it works as follows: [Skotlex]
	  Offensive Effects:
	  0: Defense ignoring damage 1~9999
	  1: Curse enemy
	  2: Blind enemy
	  3: Poison enemy
	  4: Lv10 Provoke
	  5: Def, Def2 to 0
	  6: Base Atk, Watk to 0
	  7: Flee to 0
	  8: Speed/Aspd -25%
	  
	  Deffensive Effects:
	  0: Heal 1~9999
	  1: End all negative status effects
	  2: Lv10 Bless
	  3: Lv10 Inc Agi
	  4: Aspersio (holy weapon)
	  5: Benedictio (holy armor)
	  6: +100% max hp
	  7: +100% max sp
	  8: +20 to all stats
	  9: +25% def (armor and vit)
	  10: +100% base atk
	  11: +50 flee
	  12: +50 hit
	  13: Status effect inmunity
	- Effects have a chance of 10*Skill_lv% of triggering every 5~15 secs 
	  for whoever is on the skill area.
	- Report any modifications/corrections needed on the forums.

	* Sacrificial Ritual update [Skotlex]
	* Bumped max Vending price to MAX_ZENY (currently 1000M) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug with Brandish Spear's damage. [Skotlex]
	* Changed the minimum valid char_id from 150k to 1 as apparently many sql
	  servers somehow got their chars to start from id 1 instead of 150k. [Skotlex]
	* Added a bunch of debug information to help me understand why the client
	  version check is failing. Report back the output on the forums. [Skotlex]
	* The memory manager is now OFF by default [Skotlex]
	  (if the server now crashes instead of the matrix bug, then whoever
	  gets the traceback first gets to locate it's source)
	* Various fixes to Sacrifice (self damage, display, defense reduction, etc) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Assumptio's damage reduction in pvp/normal maps [Skotlex]
	* Tiny fix to #fakename [Codemaster]

	* Updated Louyang monsters spawn (thanks to MasterOfMuppets) [Lupus]
07/15
	* Rewrote most of the packet_db handling code. [Skotlex]
	  eA now really supports multiple packet versions at the same time,
	  (so that transitioning from one packet version to another should be
	  smooth), there is no longer any need to mess with the db/packet_db.txt
	  file.
	* The values for packet_ver_flag have changed, check the battle_athena
	  comments and set it up accordingly!
	* Using the packet_db is the only way to manage packets now. [Skotlex]
	* Added sql runservers to all branches as runserver-sql.bat [Evera]
07/14
	* Fixed the login-sql registration issue. [Skotlex]
	* Made it so all ground-targetted skills fail if you try to cast them on a
	  cell you can't step in. [Skotlex]
07/13
	* Soul Change should now work on anyone in pvp/gvg maps [Skotlex]
	* Wand of Hermod's target change from 'friend' to 'party' [Skotlex]
	* Fixed triple blow's 'infinite damage delay'. [Skotlex
	* Added check to prevent placing traps on non-walkable cells. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed login-sql server not reading login_log value [Skotlex]
	* Adjusted my fix of buildin_getequipisequiped to not leave
	  the return stack tweaked [MouseJstr]
	* Changed skill_unit_onlimit to use strncpy instead of memcpy
	  in one spot to eliminate accessing unallocated memory [MouseJstr]
	* Added check into _mmalloc for allocations of less then zero
	  to make debugging easier [MouseJstr]
	* Fixed USE_MEMMGR to disable when running bounds checker or
	  the debugging malloc code [MouseJstr]
	* Fixed the debugging malloc MACRO's to use the correct arguments
	  [MouseJstr]
	* increased max maps per server to 1024 [MouseJstr]
	* Added check into buildin_getequipisequiped to make sure arguments
	  don't go outside of array boundries *crash* [MouseJstr]
	* Add a check into refine bonuses to not go outside of array
	  boundries if somebody has a wlv above 5 in the database *crash* [MouseJstr]
	* Modified skill_tree code to confirm we are still inside the 
	  skill_tree array before accessing a element from the skill_tree
	  array *crash* [MouseJstr]
	* Changed the mob spawning code to use strncpy instead of memcpy
	  in some places to avoid copying unallocated and uninitialized 
	  memory *crash* [MouseJstr]
	* Fixed the compile problem on the previous upgrade. [Skotlex]
	* Changed refine success chances to match jRO information. [Skotlex]
	  See http://tomcat1.s13.xrea.com/bs/calc.html and
	  http://eathena.deltaanime.net/board/index.php?showtopic=39997
	  for the details on the new equation.
	  (changed because the current equations seem somewhat outdated)
	* Fixed max chance const of "mob skill usage". Now all mobs aren't hyperactive. [Lupus]
	* Fixed global vars not being saved instantly (used to cause some scripts exploits) [Lupus]
	  Need some offensive testing.
07/12
	* Added Loli Ruri to the Magician set [Skotlex]
	* Fixed 'theif' on the scripts. [Skotlex]
	* Added mapflag pvp_noparty to the pvp rooms [Skotlex]
	* More Dispell Fixes [Skotlex]
	* log_login option now also works for the SQL Login server [Skotlex]
07/11
	* Fixed again Dispell. [Skotlex]
	* Added nomemo mapflag to Ayothaya Dungeon. Check your memo DBs and wipe forbidden entries [Lupus]
		- Yuno, Ayothaya Dungeon
	* Fixed Dispell succes rate reduction by MDef working reversed [DracoRPG]
	* Changed Guild auras to not be removed by Dispell (they came back when you walked
	  anyway :p) [DracoRPG]
	* Changed the default for equip_natural_break_rate to 0 (official) [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed the function that checks whether the player has valid equipment for his buffs :
	  don't return once one buff is stopped, since there can be more (e.g. Crus' shield buffs
	  will now ALL be stopped when the shield is unequipped, not only Guard ^^) [DracoRPG]
07/10
	* Fixed Alchemist Fame system using' account_id' instead of 'char_id', however this does
	  NOT solve the names problem : I left debug messages so you can see by yourself that the
	  bug comes from map_charid2nick that always returns null... [DracoRPG]
07/09
	* Added Novice Castles Usher NPC. 4 new Castles for all but 2nd classes! [Lupus]
	* Updated Falcon Assault (now gives 500% at 5 lvl) [Lupus]
	* Fixed True Sight (now gives +10 Crit, instead of +10%) [Lupus]
	* Update Sharp Shooting (now gives 350% at 5lvl) [Lupus]
	* Check other DB related skills req changes in db\changelog.txt [Lupus]
	* Updated Palm Strike to push back even if it misses. [Skotlex]
	* Updated Palm Strike cost/sphere requirement. [Skotlex]
	  (the delayed damage still needs to be coded in)
	* Now adoption.txt NPC can also teach parents/babies their missing family skills [Lupus]
	  But the skills don't work yet (I tested)
	* Massive mapflags fix. Also added there Novice Guilds. [Lupus]
07/08
	* Fixed below fix xD [DracoRPG]
	* Added another sql injection fix [Kevin]
	* Rewrote part of the name request code [Skotlex]
	  This means that now you can see other people's party even if they don't
	  belong to a guild, and the party/guild names are updated whenever someone
	  joins/leaves them. Not fully tested but works alright on the client I use
	  (0411)
	* More Adoption skill fixes. [Skotlex]
	* Added the Adoption skills to all classes [Skotlex]
	  They should be auto-granted upon adoption (and are not resetable,
	  learnable). This, of course, needs testing, do report if it does not
	  works. (those that already have someone adopted will need a custom npc to
	  give them the skills).
	* Reverted Wedding Rings as they don't need to give the adoption skills
	  anymore [Skotlex]
	* Added script command getchildid() [Skotlex]
	* Updated wedding rings to give the adoption skill when equipped. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some adoption skills [Skotlex]
	* Baby classes won't display the wedding sprite when they equip the
	  tux/wedding dress since that resets their size. [Skotlex]
	* Added warning messages when mobs from the mob_db are not loaded due to
	  invalid IDs. [Skotlex]
	* All the new monsters have been added. Check db\changelog.txt
07/07

	* Added valid fd test in inter.c char_sql - caused charserver crash [veider]
	* Fixed pet-exploit where you could use a bow with no arrow equipped to
	  'send' your pet to attack distant enemies. [Skotlex]
	* Added a visual skill effect when pets heal a status ailment. [Skotlex]
	  (Adrenaline Rush was chosen because it's animation does resemble a
	  'curative spell')
	* Changed all SQL-related error messages to use ShowSQL [Skotlex]
	  ShowSQL now is also printed on the stderr (like ShowError and ShowFatalError)
	* Beautified the output of the char server (sql) [Skotlex]
	* Modified Dispel so that it can fail. [Skotlex]
	  As I have no information of how mdef protects against it, the current
	  dummy equation is: (50+10*SkillLv - mdef)% (note that mdef2 is not used!)
	  If someone knows the actual equation, do open a bug report.
07/06
	* Fixed Spider-web (works like a ground-targeted trap) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed combo delay not working with skills that have a blowcount [Skotlex]
	* Set the default skill combo delay value to 230ms [Skotlex]
	  (this default was empirically obtained testing with Jupitel Thunder as reference)
	* Beautified output of the char server (txt) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed script config import reading. [Skotlex]
	  (was working incorrectly and causing memory leaks)
	* Another mob-ai fix, this time mobs should unlock their target once
	  it has died for sure. [Skotlex]
	* Added player_combo_damage_delay & monster_combo_damage_delay [Skotlex]
	  See battle_athena.conf for description of how they work.
	  Defaults to 0 because it is not yet tested for an appropiate default.
	* Removed player_damage_delay & monster_damage_delay [Skotlex]
	  Use player_damage_delay_rate:0 & monster_damage_delay_rate:0 instead.
	* Set item_use_interval to 0 (official default, isn't it ?) [DracoRPG]
	* Improved appearance of script-errors reported during loading. [Skotlex]
	* Some mob-ai cleanup. Mobs should now unlock their target when it has died. [Skotlex]
	* Some items, monster drops fixes [Lupus]
07/05
	* Fixed double attack damage [Skotlex]
07/04
	* Displayed name is now updated whenever a character leaves/joins a
	  party/guild. [Skotlex]
	* Added some NEW official HEADGEARS quests thanks to Lorky [Lupus]
	* Added zbuffer/lance's "Dynamic NPC Look 'n Feel" feature. [massdriller]
07/02
	* Fixed a small bug in PCloadmapevent thanks to lance. [massdriller]
	* Added lance's PCLoadMapEvent script event command. to trigger, type in
	  -[TAB]script[TAB]PCLoadMapEvent[TAB]-1,{
		YOUR SCRIPT HERE
	PCLoadMapEvent as NPC Name will trigger when players step into the map.
	OnPCLoadMapEvent as Label will trigger when players step into all maps. [massdriller]
	* Added lordalfa's NPCKillEvent script event command. to trigger, type in
	  -[TAB]script[TAB]NPCKillEvent[TAB]-1,{
		YOUR SCRIPT HERE
	}
	  The script should run everytime a normal monster is killed. [massdriller]
	* Added lordalfa's edit where Labels from Event Monsters be executed using the MVP RID, 
	  and not the Last Hit guy RID. [massdriller]
	* Added lordalfa's PCBaseUpEvent script event command. to trigger, type in 
	-[TAB]Script[TAB]PCBaseUpEvent[TAB]-1,{
	 YOUR CODE HERE;
	}
	the script should run everytime the user gains a level. [massdriller]
	* Fixed Job Quests exploits (Advanced Classes were able to pass their 2nd job quests again) [Lupus]
	  High Novices were able to pass Super Novice Job Quest as well. They weren't able to GET those
	  professions, tough. But there were some items exploits.
	  Now Advanced classes get reborn guides from all main Job Quest NPCs (1st, 2nd Classes)
07/02
	* Fixed NEWnovice NPC set using gmcommand instead of atcommand. [Codemaster]
	* Maps and bugs updates, some cleanup in Weapon Repair code [DracoRPG]

	* Fixed crashes of Baby Knight/Crusader Peco riders. Added Baby Class support into
	  AT / CHAR commands @mountpeco [Lupus]
06/30
	* Added web server (http daemon) plugin, originally by jA, ported to plugin form
	  (but not yet finished) [celest]
	  - To activate it just edit plugin_athena.conf
	  - When running just access http://<your server IP>:<your server port>. The
	    default home page is httpd/index.html, you can edit it if you want.
	  - If graph creation is enabled you can view them in http://..../graph
	    (by default only memory usage graphs are added)

	* Fixed a missing foreign key for guild_position in the SQL 
	  guild convert files (main.sql has it already) [Aru]
	* On Guild_skill table corruption in SQL: this is a problem with
	  some MySQL versions not supporting the syntax used in 
	  convert_guild_tables properly. The solution is to drop table 
	  guild_skill and re-create it with the query from main.sql. [Aru]
06/29

	  situations where knockback should be disabled (GvG/MVP) [Aru]

	  SQL users run upgrade_svn2331.sql [Aru]
	* Added convert_guild_tables2.sql for use on guild tables

	  if a guild is deleted. [Aru]

06/22
	* Stopped looting from Chase Walk [Aru]
06/21

	  - Changed damage log by summoned mobs will use their masters' char_id instead
	    of account id (old system)
	* Some tidying up in atcommand.c [celest]
06/20
	* Large monsters now have 2x base stats, drop rates, exp, and zeny (if enabled). [Valaris]
	* Small monsters now have half base stats, drop rates, exp, and zeny (if enabled). [Valaris]

	* Removed wedding rings from hasitems script command. [Valaris]
	* Removed monsters_ignore_gms from battle_athena.conf, and added @monsterignore command. [Valaris]
06/19
	* Sirius: Even though the `id` field is never directly read or 
	  written by Athena it is neccesary for the SQL server which 
	  automatically handles it. Else each char may have only 1 item 
	  in a given table. [Aru]
	* overhauled PA_SACRIFICE. If you want to revert the old 
	  behavior, you can comment out the new line for it in 
	  skill_db.txt [Aru]
	* removed broken SQL "upgrade" script [Aru]
	* finished the mapservers direct char loading / Charsaving (SQL only!) [Sirius]

	* Fixed crash in exporting ip address to plugins [celest]
06/15
	* Small mod on the new attack function to prevent Asura Strike from
	  overflowing and doing minimal damage instead of insane damage. [Skotlex]
	* Merged Iro's patch to get #changesex working. Try it out. [Skotlex]
	* nullpo fix (guild.c:550), it was an actual possible scenario when you
	  invite someone to a guild and quit before they reply. [Skotlex]
	* Removed script command gmcommand and replaced it with atcommand &
	  charcommand. [Skotlex]
	* Small fix regarding speed updating for Cast Cancel + Freedom of Cast [Skotlex]

	  - Fixed guild/normal storage flags not working right.
	  - Fixed a bug which allowed players to store items regardless of
	    restrictions.
	  - Modified the gm override level behaviour on trades so a high level gm
	    can both give and receive the otherwise untradeable item.
	* Small fix to the sql-files/convert_guild_tables.sql script.	[Skotlex]
	* Modified function status_calc_speed to be faster since it's only used for
	  cloaking and freedom of casting.	[Skotlex]
	* Changed the stacking type from speed-bonuses to make it harder to reach max
	  walk speed.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bug on the way aspd bonuses stack.	[Skotlex]
	* Changed map names length from 24 to 16 all over the char(txt/sq) and map
	  servers, this could fix the "matrix" bug (if done right...).	[Skotlex]
	* General cleanup and memory checks on char server (txt)	[Skotlex]
	* Miscellanous memory checks around charcommand.c and atcommand.c [Skotlex]
	* Added Maeki's fix to Maeki's fix of SQL Char Server Guild Saving.
	* Fixed characters not being able to uncloak
	* Split used-by-plugins-only code to plugin.h [celest]
	* Standardised plugin functions and names -- dll.c is now plugins.c, addon_athena
	  is now plugin_athena.conf and so on [celest]
	* Updated UPnP plugin to 1.0.3.1 [celest]
	  - moved code in socket.c back into the plugin
	  - added configuration file support (plugins/upnp.conf) -- you'll need to do
	    'make plugins' to install it
	* Added 'make zlib' for compiling a zlib.dll [celest]
06/13
	* Fixed Asura Strike possibly doing minimal damage when it should do very
	  large damage instead.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed another possible crash on chrif... [Skotlex]
	* Applied Maeki's fix for Guild Sql Char server	[Skotlex]
	  if it breaks, go stone him :X (I already got enough rocks to watch
	  out for...)
	* Made berserk-cancels-users-other-self-buffs a battle_config 
	  option, default: off [Aru]
	* Some compiler warnings fixes	[Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config option equip_natural_break_rate. [Skotlex]

	* Fixed map server failing to connect to char server... [Skotlex]
	* Char-Sql server	revision [Skotlex]
	  Miscellanous memory bounds/overflows checks/fixes.
	* Fixed options start_armor/start_weapon (char sql)	[Skotlex]
	* Some more map server memory checks and cleanup (90%) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed cloaking re-cloaking you instead of cancelling cloak. [Skotlex]
	* Double Damage multiplier applied after vit/def reductions until further
	  information is available. [Skotlex]
	* Restored previous speed stacking type until a fix for the new method can
	  be devised. [Skotlex]
	* Removed MVP status from @summon'd monsters. [Valaris]
	* Had the "monster target reset to none" code inside of check for the monster level up code, moved it out. [Valaris]
	* Added update of mob hp display on monster level up if mob hp display and monster leveling are on. [Valaris]
	* Added mob_clear_delay option to battle_athena.conf.
	  Can add a delay before sending monster death packet (time is in milliseconds and default 0 is off).
	  Increasing this can fix the problem with monster sprites still appearing after it died.  Recommended value: 10. [Valaris]
	* Fixed spawning multiple sized monsters via scripts. [Valaris]
	* Added LittleWolf's mode 256 (0x100 internally) for monsters (adds detect hidden to a monster, doesn't have to be an MVP, demon or insect). [Valaris]
	* Fixed bug allowing players to cast warp portal under players and other various invalid blocks. [Valaris]
	* Removed talk conversion of Zherlthsh and Alice pets since clients now support them.  Thanks to Kholdstare for pointing it out. [Valaris]
	* Added "ORDER BY" statement to char-server SQL's reading of the memo db, fixing problems with people's memo lists
	  screwing up when they log back in.  Not sure if this problem exists in TXT char-server as well. [Valaris]
	* Map server memory cleanups... (85%) [Skotlex]
	* Removed battle option "enemy_critical" [Skotlex]
	  Use enemy_critical_rate=0 instead.
	* Changed the default of enemy_critical_rate to 0 [Skotlex]
	* Ported oA's imalive and flushtimer system to eAthena plugin 'gui' [celest]
	  - You will only need the plugin if you are using a gui program like wxOAGUI
	    to run Athena
	  - To configure it check addons/gui.conf
	  - Passing "--gui" as a parameter, i.e "./map-server --gui" will activate it
	    as well (GUI program creators, you should handle this transparently)
	* Added get_uptime to timer.c -- used by @uptime and the 'sig' plugin [celest]
	* Merged the 'uptime' plugin into 'dump' and renamed to 'sig' -- it'll now
	  handle both crash and uptime logging [celest]
	* Guild SQL updated again, `exp` and `next_exp` to BIGINT UNSIGNED [CLOWNISIUS]
	* Updated the guild_upgrade made sure UNIQUE KEY guild_id is implemented [CLOWNISIUS]
	* Pets no longer lose intimacy when you die on a nopenalty map [Aru]
06/12
	* Removed the dynamic mob messages (mobs spawned/removed) from default output [Skotlex]
	  (Use battle_config etc_log to enable them again)
	* Fixed sql-files/convert_guild_tables.sql so that it actually works	[Skotlex]
	  (works only on non-modified guild tables previous the new guild system)
	* Small nullpo fix on @where. 
	* Fixed new account flood protection blocking _M/_F registration (txt/sql) [Skotlex]
	  The bug? The default disallowed time was 1 registration every 10K secs.
	* Found & fixed the bug that was causing server instability on clif.c [Skotlex]
	* Cloaked characters will uncloak on attack/skill-use [Skotlex]
	* Fix on aspd_rate affecting skills not working [Skotlex]
	* Miscellanous small fixes in map server.	[Skotlex]
	* The new attack function is now the unchangeable default. [Skotlex]
	* Updated double_rate (side-winder) behaviour.	[Skotlex]
	  It no longer adds to double attack's skill rate, instead the higher of
	  the two will be used on the currently equipped weapon.
	* Dec Agi now cancels Cart-Boost and viceversa as explained by Ishizu [Skotlex]
	* Cloaked characters now can't pick items. [Skotlex]
	* Made the max speed rate a battle_config option, default 300% [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the overflowed valstr free on skill.c:8840 [Skotlex]
06/11
	* Lord Knight's Beserk now cancels all the caster's other 
	  self-buffs when used. It also cannot be re-used during the
	  no-SP-recovery penalty period after it expires. (This penalty 
	  will now cancel on your death however.) [Aru]
	* Reverted the previous stacking type for aspd as per rodatazone
	  information [Skotlex]
	  Speed modifiers, however, still stack on the new way as there's been
	  complains of characters reaching impossibly high walk speeds.
	* Modified bAspdAddRate code so that it stacks linearly. [Skotlex]
	* Changed default stacking type for skill modifiers [Skotlex]
	  If you have +50 aspd and +50aspd you won't get 100% aspd, instead now you
	  get 50% of the 50%, that is 75% aspd bonus. Changed meant to protect
	  against stacking skills to get impossibly high walking speed/attack
	  speeds.
	* Modified the way bAspdRate & bSpeedRate work. [Skotlex]
	  They are meant to be non-stackable, so only the card/equipment with the
	  highest bonus prevails.(items with stackable bonus should use
	  bAspdAddRate & bSpeedAddRate instead.)
	* Changed the DoppelGanger Card definition from bAspdRate to bAspdAddRate
	  to make it stackable. [Skotlex]
	* Capped walkspeed at 4x default [Aru]
	* Added Maeki's awesome convert_guild_tables.sql
	  You must still manually add the `char_id` field to the `guild`
	  table and fill it with the guildmasters' char_ids BEFORE
	  running it. [Aru]
	* Removed inter_guild_storage_delete calls from int_guild, 
	  innodb tables make it unneccessary [Aru]
06/10
	* Updated the default pet_db.txt support values	[Skotlex]
	  We don't have an official list of the support rates, but 1% as default
	  (1.5% if they have max intimacy) is just ridiculous.
	* More map server memory cleanups... (70%) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed that crash upon login.... 	[Skotlex]
	* More map server memory cleanups...  (45%) [Skotlex]
	* More map server memory bound cleanups and checks (35%) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Stalkers being able to use (plagiarized) ground-target
	  skills from Chase Walk
	* Fixed come confusion between MVPs (status_get_mexp) and 
	  mini-bosses (mode & 0x20) in battle.c
	* Added battle_config option item_use_interval with default 500ms [Skotlex]
	* Started map server memory bounds checking for overflows (20%) [Skotlex]
	* Small optimizations on ensemble skills [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some compile warnings on char-sql server [Skotlex]
	* Added script function getitemslots(item_id);	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a bunch of script functions generating a new dummy item instead of
	  failing when the item was not found.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed mobhp display so that it will be displayed no matter which /showname option a player is using. [Valaris]
	* Fixed names with disguises (I tested it. It works. No more bitching. :P). [Valaris]
	* Completely overhauled SQL guild code to use innodb type tables
	  unfortunately, old guild tables are not compatible.
	  If you don't mind the data loss, wipe your current guild 
	  tables and run guild_tables.sql to create new guild tables. 
	  [Aru and CuteBoi]
	* If you want to manually convert your old guild tables, you'll
	  need to add the foreign keys from guild_tables.sql to the 
	  databases. And add the `char_id` field to the guild table.
	  Its value needs to be the char_id of the guildmaster [Aru]
	* Added 'alchemist' mob skill condition [celest]
	* Rewrote most of the old jA Self Destruction code [celest]
06/09
	* Fixed a possible null_po in clif.c:7714 caused by lagged clients [Skotlex]
	* Fixed enemy damage_delay being modified by 400 instead of 100. [Skotlex]
	* Changed behaviour of map_freeblock/map_freeblock_unlock as the previous
	  way seems to cause memory leaks. [Skotlex]
	* Tidied up code relating to skill_get_inf2() [Skotlex]
	* skill_db.txt updated. New inf2 values:	[Skotlex]
	  16: Guild skill, 32: Song/Dance skill, 64: Encore skill
	* Other misc arrangements to skill_db.txt (see db/Changelog) [Skotlex]
	* Tidied up code relating to skill_get_nk()	[Skotlex]
	* Readded the previously removed skills from item_db [Skotlex]
	* getpetinfo(2) will return "null" on no pet. [Skotlex]
	* Tidied up code relating to skill_get_inf() [Skotlex]
	* Some small fixes to @grind, @useskill [Skotlex]
	* Added fist (bare hands) to the list of unbreakable equipment in
	  pc_break_equipment	[Skotlex]
	* Reestructured battle_config options for equipment breaking [Skotlex]
	  Removed equipment_breaking and added equip_self_break_rate,
	  equip_skill_break_rate. Read battle_athena.conf for more info.
	* Fixed getpetinfo(2) crash. [Skotlex]
	* Added a couple missing lines from my PSIBlade merge of disguises. Name, attacking 
	  and such are fixed now with disguises. [Valaris]
	* Added battle_config option to set if advanced job skills may be plagiarized
	* Fixed ASC_BREAKER to ignore race/size/element cards like it should
	* Changed @fakename so it no longer needs to teleport the client to work [celest]
	* Removed the old day/night system that uses the blind effect [celest]
	* Fixed day/night cycles with darkness_level on not refreshing properly [celest]
	* Fixed pc_follow_timer cancels if the player or the target warps [celest]
	* Added @follow on the same target for the 2nd time will stop following [celest]
	* Added Memory manager will perform a hash check when freeing memory, by
	  End_of_exam / jA 1213 -- fixes crashes when a pointer created by level 2 ALLOC
	  is passed to level 1 aFree
06/08
	* Updated idle time considerations. [Skotlex]
	  A character's idle time is reset upon: Walking, attacking (auto-attack
	  counts too), using a skill or using a item.
	* idle_no_share changed from a Yes/No setting to # of seconds before
	  considering character idle (no/0 still disables). [Skotlex]
	* Updated idle_no_share description in battle_athena.conf
	* Modified @disguise so that it will always work with Npc/Mob names and Mob
	  Ids. Only npc by id is hardcoded for now.	[Skotlex]
	* Added atcommands cleanmap, npctalk, pettalk to atcommand_athena.conf with their
	  description.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed spawn delays for anthell eggs	[Skotlex]
	* Removed equipment_breaking, use equipment_break_rate = 0 instead.
	  [Skotlex]
	* Clarified some of the comments in battle_athena.conf [Skotlex]
	* Steal/Snatcher won't work on summoned creatures now. [Skotlex]
	* Some db updates (see db/Changelog) [Skotlex]
	* Fixed rude_attacked state not being reset after triggered, credits to
	  Komurka [Skotlex]
	* GM used Type 11 items will be exempt from the "GMs can do whatever they
	  want" rule regarding skill_usage because otherwise the used item is never
	  consumed.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed Ice Falchion/Firebrand giving skills, they just cast the spell [Skotlex]
	* Reduced Ice Falchion's freezing chance from 5% to 1% [Skotlex]
	* Added Makefile caching [celest]
	  'Makefile.cache' is created when you compile for the first time, and keeps
	  all your makefile definitions so it can be read directly when you recompile,
	  instead of redetecting things one-by-one.
	  'Make [char_sql/login_sql/map_sql]' will now work properly too.
	  NOTE: A cache file created by compiling txt is NOT compatible with SQL, but
	  a cache created by SQL is compatible with TXT! Delete the cache file first
	  and compile SQL before TXT if you have to.
	* Skills will reset at level down. [davidsiaw]
06/07
	* Temporary change of the way mob memory is removed when they don't have a
	  respawn time (check for memory leaks fixed after killing all summoned mobs)
	  [Skotlex]
	* Fixed map_quit being called twice when a player requests to change char [Skotlex]
	* Fixed compile issues on various versions of linux

	* Removed use of 'l' as prefix for temporary variables. [Skotlex]
	* Updated max hair styles in battle_conf to 23 [Skotlex]
	* Updated map server to jA1159~1203 [celest]

	  - Fixed memory leak when map cache reading has an error
	  - Fixed a bug when receiving member info for an empty guild
	  - Skip still connecting players in clif_foreachclient()
	* Weather will now properly appear/disappear without having to refresh the client. [Valaris]
	* Complete monster disguise re-code: [Valaris]
	  -No more client crashes in PVP caused by disguises.
	  -Can view own attack/hit/cast/sit/turn animations.
	  -Monster sprite syncs up better than before.
	  -Fixed stat dupe exploit with disguises.
	  -Fixed crashes that prevented peco riders with disguises.
	  -No more refreshing of the screen when equipping/unequipping disguises.
	* Fixed crashes caused by Graffiti Cleaner. [Valaris]
	* Added following missing checks to Ensembles: [Valaris]
		-Partner's equipment is an instrument.
		-Partner is alive.
		-Partner is not casting another skill (This allowed dance floor panel duping).
		-That both people are in a party (before if both partner's were in no party (party ID 0)

06/06
	* Fixed and updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match with the current
	  db/item_db.txt	[Skotlex]
	* Removed variables with prefix "l" being treated as a temporary
	  variables by the scripting engine.	[Skotlex]
	* Updated description of idle_no_share battle_config option	[Skotlex]
06/05
	* Added more debugging information to login-in characters to track down the
	  authook nullpo problem.	[Skotlex]
	* Added a temporary string length check on trade-request.	[Skotlex]
	  (reports seem to indicate that the map-server garbage text bug could be
	  related to trading string length overflow, check the map-server output
	  for "name too long" messages).
	* Fixed a few Visual Studio compile errors and warnings - not completely fixed [Codemaster]
	* prevent_logout is now overriden by dead characters.	There's no point in
	  waiting 10 secs since you were killed to quit/change character. [Skotlex]
	* Passive mobs will now unlock their target once it's dead/gone too
	  far/in another map.	[Skotlex]
	  Passive mobs are supposed to be defensive, not vengeful. Do report of any
	  abuses that might be possible from this to take proper measures.
	* Fixed pet lures always failing (oops) [Skotlex]
	* Corrected Various Jur's (id 1264) equip script to bonus2 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed status_get_speed always returning 1000 when invoked on NPCs [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config option pet_support_min_friendly [Skotlex]
	  Specifies minimum pet intimacy/friendly value needed before attacking.
	  Default 900, see battle_athena.conf for more information.
	* Some reorganizing of pet-catching code	[Skotlex]
	* Now mobs will do the /ag emotion when you use a lure on them and they
	  can't be caught (wrong lure, or mob not in the mob_db.txt).	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a timer mismatch situation with pc_walk timers [Skotlex]
	* Re-structured the pc_follow_timer code	[Skotlex]
	* Updated the pet_heal_timer code to match behaviour with
	pet_supportskill_timer's one	[Skotlex]
	* Added support for universal lure. [Skotlex]
	  Use use_script "pet 0;" to create an item that will catch any non-boss
	  mob (will work as long as said mob has an entry in mob_db.txt, of course)
	  From what I read in the code, mapping multiple entries in mob_db.txt to
	  the same egg_id should work, so it should be possible to have all mobs as
	  pets using a single egg_id item and this custom lure.
	* Updated Weapon Repair from jA 1228 [celest]
	* Fixed TXT char disconnecting when sent a server packet from SQL map [celest]
	* Fixed login failing with md5 encryption, thanks to End_of_exam
	* Fixed lock_fclose() failing in Win32 builds, thanks to End_of_exam
	* Updated sql-files/mob_db.sql to match with db/mob_db.txt	[Skotlex]
	* Corrected Zherlthsh's and Alice's attack animation speed (mob_db.txt)	[Skotlex]
	  sql-users can use upgrade_svn2068.sql to update table mob_db.
	* Re-fixed disp_hpmeter not getting disabled when set to 0/no	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed Grandcross/DarkCross to do 3 hits instead of 4 [Skotlex]
	* Fixed #fakename =). [Kevin]
	* Tidied up and rearranged Makefile a bit [celest]
	  - added 'make [common/map/login/char] options' -- only for txt though ^^;
	  - readded sse, mmx and o3 optimisation flags (disabled by default) -- you'll
	    have to edit and enable them yourself
06/04
	* Moved @charchangesex to #changesec *still disabled*. [Kevin]
	* Fixed a major security hole in the mail system, thanks to Valaris for the info =). [Kevin]
	* Moved @charsk/stpoint to #sk/stpoint. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charmodel to #model. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charst/skreset to #st/skreset. [Kevin]
	* Re-updated sql-files/item_db.sql to use price buy/sell NULL instead of 0	[Skotlex]
	  The file is full of REPLACE instead of INSERT, so if you already have the
	  structure of the table right, you can just delete the table definition
	  and apply the file to update your item_db table.
	* Commented out char_athena.conf. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charlostskill to #lostskill. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charquestskill to #questskill. [Kevin]
	* status_change_start will halt silently instead of printing null_po messages
	  when trying to apply  status effects on pets	[Skotlex]
	  (Fixes null_po's from pets doing magnum break and who knows what other
	  skills)
	* Moved #showexp and #showdelay to @showexp and @showdelay. [Kevin]
	* Moved @charjoblvl and @charbaselvl to #joblvl and #baselvl. [Kevin]
	* Readded the cloth dye packet upon-walk. Sorry about that [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Party Exp Even Share	[Skotlex]
	* Added #fakename, due to popular demand =)[Kevin]
	* Clothe dye is updated now on view_class change	[Skotlex]
	  Most noticeable effect: Dye is not lost un unequipping a tuxedo/wedding dress.
06/03
	* Updated sql-files/item_db.sql to match with the current db/item_db.txt [Skotlex]
	* Added some initialization code regarding dynamic mobs during map startup. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed the typo on Thief's Sling Stone quest (Zargon->Garlet)	[Skotlex]
	  Why noone fixed this before? o.O
	* Removed a piece of code that updates your cloth's dye whenever you walk.
	  I have been testing for a bit, and this piece of code seems unneeded, and
	  not only that, it causes quite a bandwidth penalty by sending
	  dye-changing packets every time every character walks!	[Skotlex]
	  If you get reports that the characters are getting displayed their
	  default color instead of their selected dye, report it so I add back that
	  piece of code (but it would be best if we could do without it, it would
	  save quite some bandwidth).
	* Some compiler fixes in older versions of GCC, thanks to esca.
	* Some optimizations to petskill_use	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed the default max hair dye color count, it is 8, not 9 @.@	[Skotlex]
	* Changed disp_hpmeter's behaviour so that you can disable it by setting it
	to "no" or 0.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed gm chat kick protection.	[Skotlex]
	* 'Tidied' a bit party_exp_share (more like restructured it).	[Skotlex]
	* Re-added party_idle_no_share code. When was it removed? [Skotlex]
	* Added skills going damanage when PVP isn't on fix. [Kevin]
	* Fixed the party-even-share bonus for large parties. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed gm chat kick protect.[Kevin]
	* GM of higher or equal level can use @where on another GM.[Kevin]
	* Fixed @fakename command.[Kevin]
	* Stopped the map-server from invoking "OnAgitStart" each time it connects
	to the char server.	[Skotlex]
	* Modified Abracadabra code to make it work with Pet Skills	[Skotlex]
	  (Warning: Not yet tested)
	* fixed a bug with Abracadabra
06/02
	* fixed compile issues on older gcc, thanks to esca [Shinomori]
	* Added @size and @fakename gm commands. [Kevin] 
	* Added valaris's getstrlen and charisalpha functions into the script parser. [Kevin]
	* Added clif_guild_xy(_remove), rest needs to be added somewhere. [Kevin]
	* Fixed items lost on shutdown/crash, by valaris. [Kevin]
	  -Note: Was partially finished by massdriller =).
	* A few things: [Kevin]
	  -Fixed valaris's gms can't be kicked function.
	  -Added battle_config option for valaris's function.
	  -Added battle_config option for gms can join password protected chats of valaris's .
	* Moved "readme"'s and other non important files into doc/notes/ [massdriller]
	* Cleanup in chat.c, party.c, storage.c [celest]
	* Fixed an inconsistent message for log_chat in conf file reading [celest]
	* Fixed mob class changing not checking array bounds, by Shinomori
	* Fixed mob summoning slaves not checking array bounds, by Shinomori
	* Updated max packets in clif.c [celest]
	* Fixed some compile time warnings.	[Kevin]
	* Added GM chat kick protections, thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
	* Added Password protection chat rooms access to gms, thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
	* Fixed a couple of things in map.c, thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
	* Storages now saves upon closing, thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
	* exp share and added zeny share/party bonus exp thanks to Valaris [massdriller]
06/01
	* Fixed Divest Shield and Divest All not able to strip shields [DracoRPG]
	* Changed the default max_hitrate to 100% as specified in rodatazone [Skotlex]
	* Removed the console messages printed when the script command getmapxy is
	  invoked	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed non-droppable items blocking the client from further droping 
	  other items	[Skotlex]
	* Changed the default of mob_remove_delay to 5 mins	[Skotlex]
	* Changed the minimum mob_remove_delay to 15 secs since mobs with instant
	  respawn actually take 5~10 secs to respawn	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed again disp_hpmeter, it looks like this time it works properly. [Skotlex]
	* Added Esca's fixes to make eA properly compile under Sun-OS	[Skotlex]
	* Tested and fixed script function getnameditem	[Skotlex]
	  Now you can use getnameditem(item,char) to get inscribed equipment (only
	  works with what you can equip, arrows excluded). The item description can
	  be the item id or the item name, and the character can as well be the
	  character id or character name. Function returns 1 if successful and
	  the character who's name is to be inscribed HAS to be online.
	* Changed the way dynamic mobs are removed. Now all mobs have are tagged as
	  either cached/uncached, and only those cached are removed	[Skotlex]
	  Mob-Slaves are the only non-cached enemies that are also tagged as
	  cached.
	* Fixed a delete_timer mismatch in pet.c	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed some compile time things in older versions of gcc. [Kevin]
	* Removed the clif message when you can't drop items [Skotlex]
	  Apparently this message breaks the clients and prevents further drops of
	  items? Might need further testing.
	* Changed AspdRate and SpeedRate bonuses so they can stack [DracoRPG]
	* Added script function getnameditem	[Skotlex]
	  syntax: getnameditem itemid, inscribed char's name
	  Needed at least for wedding scripts. Only works on equippable items,
	  returns 1 on success, always makes only 1 item.
	  (it should also be able to use char's id or item's name instead)
	  Script function proof-read but not yet tested, so it might have a bug or
	  two, use at your own risk for now.
	* Fixed dynamic mobs removing Guardians [Skotlex]
	* Fixed sql queries in logs giving an error. [Kevin]
	* Fixed @memo ignoring the nomemo map flag, thanks to Maeki. [Kevin]
	* Enabled an account flood protection system defaulting to 1 account every 10 seconds. [Kevin]
	* Corrected dynamic mob unloading to remove slaves. [Skotlex]
	* Added Maeki's fix for handling the sql connection to the log server [Skotlex]
	* A reminder to people who seem to have a broken item_db (wrong item
	  sprites, doing nothing on click, etc): there was an update to item_db
	  some days ago, a new column which is used to determine refineable 
	  items (which goes between eLv and View) The shipped item_db.txt is
	  already updated, but if you have custom files, you can try updating
	  them using the gawk line (further below this changelog) or this short
	  sed command (from within the db directory):
	  gsed -re 's/([^,]*,){16}/&,/' < item_db.txt > item_db.fix
	  And then replace item_db.txt with the newly created file (if ya don't
	  have gsed, try sed. All *nix should come with one or the other, and you
	  can also get it with cygwin)
	* Moved the dynamic mob spawns/deletes to map_addblock/map_delblock [Skotlex]
	  This pretty much guarantees that mobs won't be spawned/deleted twice from
	  the same map.
	* Added random's battle_config flag for enabling/disabling dynamic mobs [Skotlex]
	  Dynamic mobs is good for medium to small servers, but on large ones it
	  gets to be somewhat pointless.
	* Fixed disp_hpmeter, I think (can't test it, but the code looks ok) [Skotlex]
	* Added battle athena option mob_remove_delay [Skotlex]
	  Now dynamic mobs are not removed inmediately, but after some time has
	  passed. Default value is 60 secs
	* Added debugging information about dynamic mobs [Skotlex]
	  Helps keep track of how many mobs are being removed/spawned, use it to
	  track any possible bugs! Should be removed after dynamic mobs are good
	  enough.
	* Some changes to dynamic mob unloading to avoid remove summoned mobs and
	always remove mob slaves.	[Skotlex]
	* Fixed a nasty pc.c bug thanks to komurka [massdriller]
	* Added Sasuke's modification to allow certain gm levels to see the 
	  hp bars [massdriller]

05/31
	* Added Einbroch mobs to dead branch DB [Arutema]
	* Fixed NPC Typo [Codemaster]
	* Updated help.txt, fixed a compile time warning on BSD systems. [Kevin]
	* @marry auto-gives named rings, removed @rings as in-needed [Arutema]
	* Fixed some compilation errors in BSD systems. [Kevin]
	* Restored dynamic mob cleaning to what it was a couple of nights ago
	  Should send the system back before all hell broke loose. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle_config options min_hitrate & max_hitrate	[Skotlex]
	  These only affect the new attack function, and th defaults are 5%-95%
	* Added client-messages for when an item can't be drop/stored [Skotlex]
	* Finished implementing the "optimization" item_trade.txt [Skotlex]
	* Optimised the long forgotten MVP arena [massdriller]

05/30
	* Rewrote the trade-add-item function, it was hella messy [Skotlex]
	* Updated item_trade.txt implementation [Skotlex]
	  GM-override lv is still to be implemented.
	  Code has been reviewed, but not actually tested yet, use with caution.
	* Fixed fame list first loading, at server startup [DracoRPG]
	* added lordalfa's @me action command [massdriller]
	* Reverted changes to dynamic mob removal, now all mobs are removed [Skotlex]
	  mob_remove_damaged is still respected.
	* Partial implementation of item_trade.txt, not quite finished yet [Skotlex]
	* Fixed mob_remove_damaged [Skotlex]
	* Added two new battle_athena options:	[Skotlex]
	  show_hp_sp_drain (yes/no): displays drained hp/sp from attacks (ie:
	  Hunter Fly Card)
	  show_hp_sp_gain (yes/no): displays gained hp/sp from killing mobs (ie:
	  Sky Deleter Card)
	* bHPGainValue, bSPGainValue will only display gained hp/sp when said
	gain is above 0. [Skotlex]
	* Changed hp_dispmeter from yes/no to GM-level [Skotlex]
	  Note that now the default value is hp_dispmeter: 100
	* Fixed item_avail.txt reading could crash on newline [celest]
	* Speedup and fixed @reloaditemdb messing up inventory data [celest]

05/29
	* Optimised job quests scripts [massdriller]
	* Fixed guild expulsion bug, two chars on same account would be expelled. [Kevin]
	* Dynamic mob unloading won't touch mobs with a deletetimer now [Skotlex]
	  this affects mobs scheduled to be removed (including @summon mobs)
	* Dynamic mobs now also removes mobs that have a master [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Knockback skills on the new attack function [Skotlex]
	* Rewrote the vitality reduction equation in the new attack funcion [Skotlex]
	  The new equation conforms to rodatazone's information here:
	  http://rodatazone.simgaming.net/mechanics/substats.php#def
	* Fixed item_db.txt to contain the new refinable column [Skotlex]
	  (I accidentally commited the old item_db last time...)
	  TXT users with custom items can update their custom db using gawk (*nix
	  or under Cygwin) this way (thanks to Sasuke):
	  gawk -F, '{ for (i=1; i<= NF; i++) { if (i==16) { printf $i; printf ",";printf ","; } else if ( i==NF ) { print $i; } else { printf $i; printf ","; } } }' db/item_db2.txt > item_db2.new.txt
	  Run it from within the root eAthena directory, and you'll get an updated
	  item_db2.txt in your root directory. However, all custom items are not
	  refineable by default this way, you still have to set to 1 the refineable
	  column where it applies on your custom item_db.
	* Improved uptime checking, by Shinomori
	* Improved calltable import/exporting, by Shinomori
	* Standardised init/finalise functions' names [celest]
	* Fixed SVN version display at client connection, thanks to Maeki [DracoRPG]
	* Prevented Snatcher to try stealing players and already stolen mobs, thanks to shadow [DracoRPG]
	* Fixed Parrying and slightly organized status_change_start [DracoRPG]
	* Removed fame list update timer and made it to refresh the list everytime pc_addfame is ran [DracoRPG]

05/28
	~ Name of NPC file in map_athena.conf is now scripts_main.conf
	~ Added a new column to item_db.txt/item_db2.txt: refineable [Skotlex]
	  The column goes between equip_level and view, use upgrade_svn1863.sql
	  to update sql tables (including item_db2.txt). Custom item users of txt
	  servers will have to update manually.
	  When the column's value is 0, NULL (sql) or blank (txt), the item can't be
	  refined.
	  OLD ITEM_DBS WILL NOT WORK WITH THIS NEW UPDATE, update your custom
	  items!
		
	* Fixed a crash bug in pet_heal_timer on timer mismatch. [Skotlex]
	  Thanks to Celest for noticing it out.
	* Fixed the critical attacks bug in the new attack function. [Skotlex]
	* Added MassDriller's updated readme.html files. [committed by Skotlex]
	* Fixed script_athena.conf reading of "event_requires_trigger". [Skotlex]
	  It was looking for "require_set_trigger" instead of
	  "event_requires_trigger", which effectively ignored the
	  event_require_trigger's value. Logout events should now be usable without
	  the need of a global variable.
	* Registered all used timer functions to help debugging [celest]
	* Added -DMINICORE to compile core.c (for converters and ladmin) [celest]
	* Removed most unused code and files in char and login converters [celest]
	* Moved converters to /txt-converters [celest]
	* Some tidying up in core and socket.c [celest]
	* Fixed a bug in the new attack function dealing with dual-wielding [Skotlex]

05/27
	* Removed YET AGAIN the mob's skill_idle_flag function. [Skotlex]
	  Komurka updated the mob_skill_db so that it is not needed anymore.
	* Modified the critical equation on the new attack function [Skotlex]
	  The original equation ((1 + LUK*0.3 + EquipmentBonuses) * CritModifier -
	  TargetLuk/5) was meant for official servers, where mobs don't do
	  criticals. If applied to mobs, they get very high critical rate, so the
	  luk reduction was bumped up to TargetLuk*3/10 on situations where a player
	  is targeted by a mob.
	* Re-Applied the idle_skill_flag [Skotlex]
	  It was removed because people said it was broken, however it works
	  exactly the way Komurka explained it to me:
	  A mob can cast only one idle skill, and can't do another one until it
	  moves. If the mob casts too many idle skills because it
	  casts/moves/casts, then increase the skill's delay in the database! If it
	  still does "not works", drop me a line explaining why, because it works
	  exactly as I was told it should.
	* Small adjustment of the critical equation in the new attack function [Skotlex]
	* Fixed some crashes related to pet skills and timers [Skotlex]
	* Fixed 1 delete_timer error with pc_stopwalking [celest]

05/26
	* Tidied up mob.c and map.c a bit [celest]
	* Removed rehash() in atcommand.c [celest]
	* Fixed @reloadscript issue with dynamic mobs [celest]
	* Added flush fifos first before reloading in @reloadscript [celest]
	* Added spawn mobs with 1 second delay instead if moblist is full, by Shinomori
	* Fixed wrong name saved when adding friends, thanks to Maeki
	* Fixed itemhealrate stackable, thanks to starlon
	* Set the new_attack_function to be used by default. [Skotlex]
	  This function replaces the three previously used functions (pc/mob/pet)
	  into a single one which was rewritten to follow the attack algorythm as
	  described in http://rodatazone.simgaming.net/mechanics/attacks.php
	  Please report any inconsistencies or strange behaviour that this new
	  function brings (only affects physical attacks/skills) on the boards.
	  If anyone can do some performance comparisons with the old method, that'd
	  be useful too.
	  If you absolutely don't want to test it and prefer the old method, in
	  battle_athena.conf add a line that goes:
	  new_attack_function: no

05/25
	* Fixed typos in Absorb Spirits, Double Casting and Tarot Card, thanks to Komurka
	  and Avaj
	* Added missing code for Flasher, thanks to Komurka
	* Fixed a string bug in grfio_resnametable [celest]
	* Updated the readme files to the current statistics. [Mass Zero]

05/24
	* Added 'make addons' -- plugins will not be compiled by default now [celest]
	* Ported uptime logging function to eAthena plugin [celest]
	* Ported pid file creation function to eAthena plugin [celest]
	* Ported stackdump creation function to eAthena plugin [celest]
	* Added capability to export to plugins [celest]
	* Fixed ensemble skills, thanks to Komurka
	* Fixed Dissonance damage, thanks to shadow
	* Reverted db/pet_db.txt to it's original form.	[Skotlex]
	  The pet skills shipped with eA should be as close as possible to the
	  original servers. If you prefer the current custom skills in place just don't
	  update the pet_db.txt file.
`	  (Somehow my custom pet skills table got updated to svn and I didn't notice
	  it ^^') 

05/23
	* Fixed a few problems wit Dynamic Mobs [Wizputer]
		Increased max mobs per map from 32 -> 128
		Fix mob unloading
			Special Mobs w/ Spawn delays are exempted (MVPs, Gaurdians, Branches, and summoned)
			Added Option for damaged mobs not to be removed in battle config ( Default yes )
	* Mob count in scripts returned 1 less then it was supposed to. [Kevin]
	* Updated tool/stackdump script to support eA's own stackdumps [celest]
	  - Type ./stackdump help to check
	* Changed mob_cleanup_sub simply to cleanup_sub [celest]
	* Fixed some memory leaks with dynamic mobs [celest]
	  -- notes: Check bugs.txt
	* Fixed some compile warnings in gcc 4.0 [celest]

05/22
	* Added Jbain's server restarter bat files. [massdriller]
	* Drastically Improved Memory usage by making mobs dynamic [Wizputer]
		Mobs load only when a PC is present on the map
		Mobs that have special spawn delays are not loaded/unloaded
		( Reduced memory usage by 60% for 419 Maps )
	* FIFO size fixes [Shinomori]
	* Fame point system now uses pc_addfame [DracoRPG]
	* Added support for new NPC sprites in @disguise, thanks to akusarujin [DracoRPG]
	* CharSQL: changed the init / login connection issue, now 'online'
	  players will be set offline in login @ start / login reconnect [Sirius]

05/19
	* Fixed displaying new when char_new is set to one and changed the option to char_new_display. [Kevin]
	* Fixed mysql fix. [Kevin]
	* Fixed a previous fix with pet idle skills, needs db update not hard coding. [Kevin]
	* Fixed mysql queries to support the following: [Kevin]
	  -Names now support the ' character
	  -Runs faster because querying string fields doesn't do strlen.

	  - nojobexp - on killing a monster you don't obtain Job EXP at all (including MVP EXP bonus)
		nobaseexp+nojobexp=noexp

	  - noloot - on killing ANY monster you get no loot at all
	  - nomobloot - on killing a common monster you get no loot at all
	  - nomvploot - on killing a MVP monster you get no MVP loot at all
		nomobloot+nomvploot=noloot

05/12
	* Very very very strong weapons (forged with 3 Star Crumbs) now give +40 dmg
	  instead of +15 dmg [DracoRPG]
	* Weapons/potions made by a top-10 famous player now give bonus effects [DracoRPG]
	* Updated the battle.c change made to generate compile time
        errors if you put the wrong battle_config option with the
        wrong type into the wrong place [MouseJstr]
	* Added item type 11 into LOGs filter [Lupus]
	* Removed mob_skill_use, if you don't want mobskills, set mob_skill_rate to 
	  zero [Skotlex]
	* Modified drops_by_luk behaviour. See battle_athena.conf for details [Skotlex]
	  The new system works a lot like Diablo 2, where having 100% better chance
	  of finding items means that you basicly get double drop rates than others.
	* Implemented pet idle skills restrictions as explained by Komurka [Skotlex]
	  From what I was told, a mob can only cast a skill while in idle state
	  once, and it needs to move before it can do another idle-state skill.
	* Tested and fixed wedding_ignorepalette, it now works as it should [Skotlex]
	* Tested the new item type 11. I forgot to add the code for the sql
	  version, but that's now fixed and the new system works as it should [Skotlex]
	* Put a fix in for the bug mentioned below [MouseJstr]
	* Added code to make min_hair_style, max_hair_style, min_hair_color,
	  max_hair_color, min_cloth_color, max_cloth_color work [Skotlex]
	  What it does, is cap the values whenever you try to change the
	  character's dye via an npc/script, it won't touch character's dye colors
	  upon loading.
	* Shrinked @mapinfo output, added 2 missing flags NOWARP / NOWARPTO [Lupus]
	* New item type (11) to item_db: delay-consumed usables. [Skotlex]
	. All items that have in their script "pet" or "itemskill" must be changed
	  from type 2 to 11. The new type of item has the property of not being
	  consumed on double click, but after a target is selected (hence it is
	  ideal for lures, skill-casting items and the yggdrasil leaf)
	  The item_db.txt file was updated to reflect these changes. Custom pet 
	  lure owners, update!
	  SQL users can run upgrade_svn1705.sql which will upgrade both item
	  databases (including all custom lures)
	* Added battle config option 'ignore_items_gender'. [Lupus]
	  So any player can equip any item regardless of the gender restrictions.
	  Note: It's ignored by default since gender check isn't implemented at
			official servers.
	  There are 2 exceptions: Wedding Ring M/ Wedding Ring F (their gender check
	  won't be affected)

05/11
	* Added by popular demand battle config options mob_skill_rate & 
	  mob_skill_delay. See battle_athena.conf for further information. [Skotlex]
	* Added battle config option wedding_ignorepalette (default no)
	  When enabled, the wedding dress/tux will always display with the default
	  dye (not all palette packs bring palettes for the wedding class, nor
	  they should) (Needs testing)
	* Changed most battle_athena options to unsigned short. This means the
	  maximum valid value is around 60K (65535 on most systems) which 
	  translates to ~60 secs or 600% (600x) for most options. See 
	  conf-tmpl/battle_athena.conf for details on which variables were
	  excluded (exp/drop rates values are excluded, obviously).
	* Removed boss warping code since it is currently supported by the mob skill DB
	  'rudeattacked' state [celest]
	* Fixed plagiarised skills replacing actual learnt skills [celest]
	* Fixed 'gmcommand' script command crashing when no players are attached [celest]
	  ... which means the command does not work in script events like OnClock!
05/10
	* Added code to prevent pet lures from being wasted until after selecting a
	target (only works with official lures). [Skotlex]
	* Added MAX_REFINE to status.h [Skotlex]
	  Enables for custom max refine levels using the success rates in
	  refine_db.txt, npcs will know they reached the max level when the success
	  chance returns 0. (npcs still need updating to support this model)
	  - Note: Whitesmith's refinery skill might need to be tweaked if you want
	  them to be able to forge above lv10 and up to whatever custom max you
	  wish.
	  - Note2: Npc's refine_sucess script command ignores this max.
	* Skill updates [celest]
	  - Fixed Charge Arrow not requiring bows
	  - Fixed Enchant Deadly Poison working on bosses
	  - Fixed Concentration (again! xD) def penalty, thanks to UniRing
	  - Added code for NPC_REVENGE
	* Added 'masterattacked' mob skill condition [celest]
	* Added battle_config.use_statpoint_table [Skotlex]
	  When set to no, a new equation is used to calculate stat points after a
	  reset. I've tested the equation to death, so it should work flawlessly.
	  Advantages of using the equation: No need for statpoint.txt (it is still
	  read for the time being), and stat changes through npc buyers/sellers are
	  preserved after a reset.
	* Restructured clif_parse_Wanttoconnection [celest]
	* Fixed packet version detecting not working properly if last version's connection
	  packet is the same as the DB but with different values [celest]
	* Added built-in support for 2005-05-09aSakexe and changed 'packet_ver_flag'
	  default in battle conf to 511 [celest]
	* Added load local resnametables.txt into memory instead of opening and reading
	  it every time we look for a file [celest]
	* Fixed crash if resnametables.txt was not found in a grf [celest]
	* Removed some unnecessary steps in grf file lists loading [celest]
	* Added display_hallucination for clients where the effect lags badly [Skotlex]
	* Added the battle_config options for managing the pet-skills system [Skotlex]
	* Incorporated the new pet attack/skill system. [Skotlex]
	  See db/pet_db.txt for explanation, or visit 
	  http://www.eathena.deltaanime.net/board/index.php?showtopic=29918 for
	  details and support.
	* Fixed Marionette skill. Now you can't target other Clowns or Gypsies [Lupus]
	* Fixed all Hunters traps to affect Players in PVP/GVG places only. [Lupus]
	  And Shockwave Trap doesn't work on monsters, because they don't have SP

         actually impossible, because the checks handle the connection with the char server, not with users
         anyway, I checked again and rearranged code but functionality is still the same and valid [Shinomori]

          - Refer to doc/item_bonus.txt for description

        * Minor rewrites on self and enemy weapon/armor breaking during battle [celest]
        * Added missing code for 'bBreakWeaponRate' and 'bBreakArmorRate' effects
          [celest]
        * Added missing code for 'bAddStealRate' effect [celest]
        * Removed redundant 'infinite_autospell' in map_session_data [celest]
        * Fixed Treasure Box spawn bug in all castles. [Lupus]
        * Fixed wrong PresentLOG (it wasn't showing PRESENT BOX type ID) [Lupus]
	* Expanded Monsters Drops Slots from 8 to 10. Everywhere in the sources. [Lupus]
	  But in TXT / SQL monsters DB reading functions, I added a temp plug
	  to make eA work fine with existing DBs. It reads only 8 drops and fills
	  9th and 10th drops with Zero.
	  On expanding MOB_DB.TXT we'll remove that plug.
	  We are adding new cards and some monsters
	  have no free slots for them. Current state is tested and works fine.

02/12
        * Merged Dexity's pc_statpointdb into pc_readdb, changed statp's string

        * Skill Updates [celest]
          - Sharp Shooting: Dropped jA's and kA's code and wrote a new
            map_foreachinpath function in map.c -- about 14 times faster, but still
            uncomplete
          - Ankle Snare: Added matthias' suggestion to let agility reduce more trap
            time, but no less than 3 seconds.
          - Magnum Break: simplified code a bit, and changed to non-targetting /
            automatically damages an area around the caster
          - Tiger Fist: enable it to be used by its own besides as a part of
            the combo skills
          - Devotion: Fixed maximum level difference not reading its setting from
            battle_athena.conf, thanks to leinsirk
          - Soul Burn: Added some safety checks

02/10
	* Login/Login SQL: fixed the client version check function [Sirius]

02/09
	* Added conf-tmpl/readme.txt, explaining the import folder [1066: Ajarn]
	* SQL Char: Rewrote the char_create function (now it's faster/optimized) [Sirius]
	* SQL Char: Fixed the reply if a charname is invalid on create (now it replys denied..) [Sirius]

	* Corrected end-of-line issues in source code [1056: MouseJstr]
	* Coded new command: @MOBINFO <monster name|monster N> [Lupus]
	  the command has also 2 aliases: @monsterinfo, @mi
	  It shows all Monster stats, Element, Race and stuff
	  It shows all items with their drop chance
	  It also shows MVP bonuses (MVP EXP, MVP Drops)	

02/05
	* increased the max_files allowed in a grf [1054: MouseJstr]
	* Changed the way char deletion works for SQL [1051: Ajarn]
	  - If the email the client fails check then check if the
	    email is blank and the DB email is a@a.com (default)
	    If so, assume it was created with _M/_F, and delete it
	* SQL Login accepts _M/_F now [Credit to Sirius] [1049: Ajarn]
	* Map server now actually reads bind_ip [1048: Ajarn]
	  Side note: login reads bind_ip, but doesn't use login_ip now.
	* Made eA compile under AMD64 64-bit native [1047: MouseJstr]
        * Changed interface binding to use a bind_ip instead of using
          the login_ip, char_ip, or map_ip.  This lets you still be
          able to set your WAN IP seperate from what interface you
          wish to bind to.  Also, the default is back to binding to
          all interfaces on the machine.  [1045: MouseJstr]
        * optimizing OnTouch event name generation [Shinomori]
        * fixing Celests Sharp Shooting [Shinomori]
        * Updated Sharp Shooting AoE code, thanks to Neodis / k-Athena [celest]
          - Update: Adapt jA's path_search algorithm and removed the need of struct
            'dev' in map_session_data
          - Update: Increase range to 14
        * Tidied up explicit typecasts in status_get_max_hp, thanks to Ilpalazzo-sama
          [celest]
        * Non-MVP / miniboss summoned monsters should give exp, my mistake ^^; [celest]
          Note:- minibosses are considered a 'Boss' as well, not just MVP's
        * Fixed a typo that was preventing packet version 5 clients (628sak) from
          logging in (it was supposed to only block those with 4 or below) [celest]

02/04
        * Fixed more compile signed/unsigned errors [SVN 1040: MouseJstr]
	* TXT convertors now read the import command in inter_athena.conf
	  [SVN 1038: Ajarn]
        * Fixed some compile errors [SVN 1037: MouseJstr]
	* Added common/buffer.(c/h) [SVN 1033: Ajarn]
	* Login server can now set it's ip address in the config [SVN 1033: Ajarn]
	* Servers now bind to a single ip address, thus allowing multiple servers to
	  a single port [SVN 1033: Ajarn]
        * Added experimental code to generate a stack dump when it segfaults, thanks
          to Ser [celest]
          - does not work with Cygwin, as it does not have glibc
          - to enable, edit the Makefile and remove the # on the line:

                # OPT += -DDUMPSTACK -rdynamic

          - What it does: everytime eA crashes it'll generate a file "stackdump_
            <number>.txt" in your save folder with a backtrace, which you can
            examine and send to a dev to be fixed.

        * Some more tidying up in status_get_ functions [celest]

02/03
        * When loading shop scripts automatically check if the prices can be exploited
          with OC/DC [celest]
        * If the buying price provided in item_db.txt is above 2x higher than selling
          price for an item no need to reset and redetermine the buying price [celest]
        * Fixed a mistake that was causing Ruwach to only work in PvP and PvM [celest]
        * Added DracoRPG's code for Joint Beat effects, thanks! [celest]

	* Added checks to prevent some crashes in skill.c
	  [Full credit to shinomori] [SVN 1022: Ajarn]

01/31
        * Fixed a typo in Pressure causing it to deduct sp from the caster, and remove
          its sp_rate requirement [celest]
        * Updated skill_range_leniency code when casting a ground targetting spell      
          ( as in Revision 968) [celest]
        * Added Karma and Manner to const.txt
          -- To change a player's alignment to more Good/Evil in scripting for example,
             use:
                 set Karma, Karma + <number here>;

             In older exe's (11-08 or older) you can actually check your karma in the
             character alignment screen (alt-A)
             The rest is up to your scripting creativity ^^

        * Delete players' ID from id_db when kicking everyone from the map-server due
          to char disconnection -- Fixes an odd crash with lazy mob AI [celest]
	* Added at(@) command @autoloot, which turns autoloot on or off for the
	  player who uses it [Upa-Kun]
	  
01/29

        * Added some optimisations in clif_parse_MapMove, by Ilpalazzo-sama [celest]

01/28
        * Fixed a typo that was causing /in to always report failure even when the
          name was removed from the ignore list [celest]
        * Link "wisexin", "wisexlist" and "wisall" to the PM ignore functions, and
         "friendslistadd" and "friendslistremove" to the friends list functions

        * added clif_parse_PMIgnoreList (packet 0xd3) from jA [celest]
        * Added DUMP_ALL_PACKETS and moved dump packets code in clif_parse a bit to
          support it [celest]
        * Added base code for Party Item Sharing -- still needs some work in client-
          server support [celest]
	* new GC link http://amber.stormbirds.org/~joshs/gc6.4.tar.gz
	  This fixes some issues... works better
        * Added macros skill_chk and skill_get to check for out of bounds errors when
          retrieving info from the skill_db [celest]

01/27
        * Added memory leak fixes with temporary script variables and pets-related
          actions, by End_of_exam / jA 1109 [celest]

          - Fixed a bug in Safety Wall
          - Allow only either Storm Gust or Lord of Vermillion to cause damage if
            stacked together
          - Added path_search_long, map_find_skill_unit_oncell

        * Added status_get_sc_def for calculating resistance against status
          abnormalities [celest]
        * Added status.c and status.h of jA 1091 update and moved some functions into
          the new source files:
          -- skill_status_change_  ->  status_change_

          -- pc_getrefinebonus and pc_percentrefinery  ->  status_getrefinebonus and
             status_percentrefinery

        * Updated auto_counter_type's description in battle_athena, thanks to 
          akusarujin for pointing it out [celest]
        * Removed some unnecessary skill level checks in battle.c [celest]
        * Removed my changes to /stable/Makefile which has libGC enabled by default
          that i've accidentally commited, sorry ^^; [celest]
        * Removed an unnecessary "cloneskill_lv" from map_session_data [celest]
	* Removed WATER.TXT (this file wasn't used at all. There's no such mapflag as WATER even). [Lupus]
	* Added Water Height of New Yuno Fileds 9 and 11.
	  Now Water Ball works there as should. Wizards could levelup on sleepers, too. [Lupus]
        * libGC isn't ready to be the default quite yet... [MouseJstr]
        
          Enough people have asked so... Once you grab a copy of the
          libGC library from  (http://amber.stormbirds.org/~joshs/gc6.3.tar),
          you start up a bash shell from inside cygwin and untar
          the gc6.3.tar.  This will produce a gc6.3 directory.  Then
          cd into that directory and type ./configure.  Once that is
          done you type "make" and then "make install".  This will
          spray the various includes and libraries all over your
          cygwin install (most in /usr/local).  

          Now, edit Makefile and change the CC line to use the

             CC = gcc -pipe -DGCOLLECT

          entry.  Also change the GCLIB to 

             GCLIB = -L/usr/local/lib -lgc

          Remember to comment out the ones no longer used.  Do a clean
          build and good luck.  Obviously,  this has not been tested
          by that many people so you really are on the cutting edge
          but if you have good results, send me a note
          (joshs@stormbirds.org) so that we can see if it really is
          ready for prime time.

          What should you see?  Well, the map-server should not
          grow/consume extra memory anymore.  More so, it should use
          dramatically less memory then it did before using the
          garbage collector.

          The downside is that it will consume a little more CPU...

          The question is, how much?  how laggy?   what effect on lots
          of players?  I've heard stories saying it makes the server
          unplayable and others told me that they saw no
          player-visible effects at all.


01/25
        * Fixed TXT compile problems with libGC [celest]
        * Added "Clients older than 2004-09-06aSakray" option to packet_ver_flag in
          battle_athena, just in case server owners still prefer the older clients.
          With so many changes to Sakray over the past months its much better upgrading
          to the newer clients (November or higher recommended) available ;P [celest]
        * Merged Full Strip into jA's tidier stripping skills code -- also fixes
          a typo that was causing Full Strip to do the reverse effect instead,
          and the skill not updating the target's status after successfully unequipping
          items [celest]
        * Tidy up the 4 chemical protection skills into one code block [celest]
        * Corrected Slim Pitcher's code -- sorry, i missed a few things ^^; [celest]

01/24
        * Fixed a typo in Provoke that was causing crashes [celest]
        * Fixed another compile warning in src/char/char.c
          [SVN 985] [MouseJstr]
        * Fixed a account wipe bug in login/login.c (Thanks Wallex)
          [SVN 984] [MouseJstr]
        * Fixed a crash in char_sql/char.c where people were selecting
          chars before requesting connections [SVN 983] [MouseJstr]
        * some G++ compile tweaks and got through several files in the
        map server - [SVN 976]   [MouseJstr]

          Why are we doing a C++ conversion?  We have a lot of duplicate
          code and would like to make the "classes" in the server share
          code.. For example, a pet should be able to share code from
          the player or from a mob.  Similerly, introducing a new type
          of entity in the game should be as simple as creating a
          sub-class instead of having to crawl through the entire source
          tree searching for every class check and introducing handler
          code in for your new type.

          Finally, while a garbage collector is "cool", it would still
          be nice to have enough object knowledge on how to clean up
          data that it is not absolutely required.  It is faster for
          us to clean up our own messes then introduce a whole system
          for cleaning up after ourselves.

          Is there a C++ performance penalty?  Not if the code is
          written correctly.   For example
                  1) No templates - code bloat and destroys cpu cache
                     coheriancy
                  2) No C++ exceptions - slows down entering and
                     exiting functions
                  3) No operator overloading - makes it hard to
                     understand what is going on.
                  4) No C++ STL libraries - Templates, huge, bloated,
                     unportable
                  5) No method inlining - code bloat and reduces cache
                     coheriancy.  Let the optimizer do it...

	* Forgot a couple small changes [SVN 35] [Ajarn]
	* Changed map_data.gat and map_data_other_server.gat from unsigned char*
	  to char* (this might be needed, because of unicode or something, please
	  correct me if I'm wrong) [SVN 34] [Ajarn]
	* Converted decode_zip, encode_zip, remove_control_chars, mapif_sendall*,
	  and e_mail_check to use char* instead of unsigned char* (again, please test)
	  [SVN 34] [Ajarn]
        * Modified skill unit group checking in skill_unit_onplace that might have
          been causing crashes [celest]
        * Updated packet 0x143 length's for version 14 (2004-11-01Sakexe) and version
          16 (2005-01-10Sakexe), thanks to jathena and ice2big [celest]
        * Fixed login-server compile error with the "new" -> "new_" changes [celest]

01/22
	* Fixed an error that was in my last commit (optimising g++ build) [SVN 29]
	  [Ajarn]
	* Made strlib functions char*, instead of unsigned char*. Strings are meant
	  to be char. (Shouldn't break anything, but might, please test this for me)
	  [SVN 26] [Ajarn]
	* Added cast for TXT version [SVN 25] [Ajarn]
	* Added cast from allocation calls, from void* to intended type [SVN 24] [Ajarn]
	* Changed bool -> bool_. Still need to make convertions between
	  char* and unsigned char* valid, and some other convertions too.
	  Also, sizeof is being used wierd in map.c, at least g++
	  complains [SVN 22] [Ajarn]
	* Changed the rest of the class variable names to class_ and all the new
	  variable names to new_, for futher g++ support [SVN 21] [Ajarn]
        * Update both caster and target's SP after using Soul Change -- thanks to Aalye
          / Freya [celest]
        * Force a monster to switch attack target when being casted Provoke [celest]
        * Corrected description for @enablenpc -- "@npcon" -> "@enablenpc" [celest]
        * Since job normalising is still buggy require all 1st class skills to check
          for Basic Skill level when calculating the skill tree [celest]

01/21
        * Updated packet DB configurations : enable_packet_db, packet_db_ver,
          -- check the .txt for description [celest]

          Note: For people having connection problems try setting 'enable_packet_db'
          to 'no'... and use the latest client (01-10Sakexe)

        * Fixed a small typo in 12-06's packets -- 21b => 21d [celest]
        * Updated packet_db.txt to only contain the latest version, like jAthena,
          since there's not much point to re-read packets eA already supports 
          (although if you remove all the //'s it can still read multiple versions)
          [celest]
        * Added clif_config in clif.c - for keeping packet/client connections related
          stuff [celest]
        * Send 'Game Exe not latest version' to a client if it hasn't been authentified
          yet, but is sending a non-connection-related packet to prevent crashing
          -- assume the client is using an unknown exe [celest]

01/20
	* Fixed compile time problems with the non-GC case [MouseJstr]
	* Introduced aMallocA and aCallocA

	  These two functions allocate "atomic" memory which means 
	  "memory that does not contain references to other memory".

	  This lets the garbage collector ignore these objects when searching
	  memory for references to other objects dramatically increasing
	  performance of the GC.  

	  When in doubt, use aMalloc and aCalloc.  It is better to add
	  a tiny bit of work to the GC then do cause a crash due to memory
	  being cleaned up when it shouldn't.
	  [MouseJstr]
	* Modified all calls to aMalloc and aCalloc that reference
	  atomic memory to use aMallocA and aCallocA
	  [MouseJstr]
	* Modified the socket buffer allocator to use "atomic" memory
	  for the fifo data buffers [MouseJstr]
01/19
	* added support for the Hans-J. Boehm libC garbage collector
	  (A copy is in http://amber.stormbirds.org/~joshs/gc6.3.tar).  

	  It is ABSOLUTELY critical for people to use
	  aFree/aMalloc/aCalloc/aStrdup for this to work.  If somebody
	  has just used free or malloc, this will crash when used with
	  the garbage collector.  

	  A amusing environmental variable to set is GC_PRINT_STATS (to 1)
	  so that you see real time statistics of leaked data being
	  recovered.  

	  grab a copy of the gc6.3.tar.. build it .. install it.. 
	  modify the Makefile to have the 

		CC = gcc -pipe -DGCOLLECT
		GCLIB = -lgc

	  lines... and make the sql servers (the txt server doesn't
	  build using this right now due to stupid Makefile issues)

	  [MouseJstr]
	* SVN 3 on http://svn.stormbirds.org/svn/eathena will be what
	  I diff against when I merge back into delta.. if we ever merge
	  back into delta   [MouseJstr]
        * Removed 12-06 Sakexe detection, since it doesn't seem to work, and
          might be conflicting with 10-25 clients [celest]
        * Update the Soul Burn target's SP when it has been successfully reduced to 0,
          thanks to Aalye / Freya [celest]
        * Moved SC_PRESERVE and SC_BATTLEORDERS's id so they'll display a status icon
          when cast, thanks XiaoLin of cAthena [celest]
        * Added missing code for Preserve -- i totally forgot to add it ^^; [celest]

01/18
        * Added some skill bug fixes, thanks to Aalye / Freya [celest]
          - stop player attacking if the target goes into hiding
          - fixed Sword Reject not working against swords, only daggers
          - additional check in case Marionette Control doesn't end properly even
            when one of the partners has logged off
        * Added stun, bleeding and SP loss effect for Pressure, thanks to DracoRpg
          [celest]
        * TEST: Fixed more compile warnings in MSVC [celest]
        * TEST: Fixed some compile errors in MS Visual C++, thanks to Ser [celest]

01/17
        * Some rewrites in skill_delayfix [celest]
          - If the delay is < 0, add the weapon aspd delay to it
          - If the skill is not weapon type, and has 0 delay, add 300ms as default
        * Added min_skill_delay_limit as the minimum allowed delay for any skills
          [celest]
        * Some tidying up in battle_get_ functions [celest]
        * Set exp table and job bonus table to 0 before reading - might solve some
          memory bugs [celest]
        * Updated skill range leniency code - If possible try and move towards the
          skill target so that when casting it no longer falls out of range [celest]

01/15
        * Added effects to enemies for Gospel [celest]
        * Added mobs spawn to all Yuno fields (according to 4th Jan patch) [Lupus]

01/14
        * Added party supporting effects for Gospel [celest]

01/13
        * Added and testing support for 2004-12-06Sakexe [celest]
        * Removed emblem changing requiring Glory of Guild limited to TXT only [celest]
        * Corrected a typo preventing Plagiarism to work, thanks to orn [celest]
        * Fixed Berzebub card and other 'reduce cast delays' equipment not working
          [celest]
        * Updated packet_db.txt loading to support reading into multiple packet
          versions [celest]
        * Removed packet_db_ver defining in packet_db.txt -- it'll determine itself
          based on MAX_PACKET_VER [celest]
        * Integrated packet size and function DB's into 1 packet_db [celest]
        * Added MAX_PACKET_VER -- maximum versions supported by eA, including the
          packet_db -- and changed packet size and function DB's to use it [celest]
        * When sending 'Game exe not latest version' packet don't close the session 
          immediately so it will still be delivered [celest]
        * Added map-server display if an unidentified client was rejected --
          also fixes the 'empty string sent to _showmessage' [celest]
	* Added a bug - Celest, LOOK AT THIS BUG ASAP. [Codemaster]
        * Tided up/fixed some mobs [Lupus]

01/12
        * Implemented Vending Log [Lupus]
	  TODO: use log option to log only important deals (much money, rare items, etc)

01/11
        * Added Shinomori's changes to npc event timers (I never realised it, thanks
          ^^; ) [celest]
        * Updated clif.c to be able to identify client versions based on the packet DB
          [celest]
        * Correct packet_db_ver to the maximum version allowed if it was set too high 
          or too low in packet_db.txt [celest]
        * Added support for 2005-01-10Sakexe [celest]
        * Updated packet functions for 2004-11-08 and 2004-12-06 (Note: eA *can*
          support 12-06, but still doesn't recognise it... so unless we find a way,
          it is *not* supported yet) [celest]
        * Updated packet_db, thanks to Sara-chan [celest]
        * REMOVED support for clients before packet version 10 (2004-08-25 and 
          earlier) - the client will receive a 'Game Exe not latest version' message
          [celest]
        * Added a check to prevent crashing when trying to log in with
          2005-01-10aSakexe in servers that don't support it [celest]          
	* Added a fix to @sound where if you forgot the .wav exention, i'd attempt to play the file without it (it adds the .wav) [Codemaster] [SVN 949]
	* Added @disguiseall / @undisguiseall [Codemaster] [SVN 949]
	* Added misc. clif.c fixes (jAthena added alot of close(fd)'s, so i added them, too) [Codemaster] [SVN 949]
	* Added bug reports - Celest, you might want to check one of those out [Codemaster] [SVN 949]
        * Fixed a bug in clif.c which didn't allow to enther the map-server.
	  It worked under win32, but didn't under Linux. [Lupus]

01/10
        * Completed adding packet DB reading... still needs (a lot) more work in
          clif.c [celest]
        * Added Shinomori's suggestions for npc timers, thanks again ^^ [celest]
        * Removed checking for script event timers' length, and added Shinomori's
          changes [celest]
        * Start adding packet DB reading [celest]
        * Added 'max_eventtimer_length' (default is 32) to script_athena.conf. [celest]
          Some event timers with names longer than 24 could cause the server to close
          itself, change this if you need support for even longer names
        * Removed PCLoginEvent requiring 'PCLoginEvent' for the player to be set to 1
          first to be activated. [celest]
        * Added Shinomori and orn's fix for the skill tree to only check the first
          required skill in the DB and skipping the rest [celest]
        * Modified 'wedding' script command to work with "OnTimer" scripts even without
          doing 'attachnpctimer' (The 'player not attached' error will still display,
          but the effect will appear *over the NPC* instead of the player...
          at least it won't fail ^^) [celest]
        * Added 'attachnpctimer' script command for attaching the player to the current
          npc's timer in "OnTimerxxxx" scripts, thanks to Wallex for the idea. [celest]
          Syntax:
                 attachnpctimer;
                 attachnpctimer "<Player Name">;

          Check /npc/sample/npc_test_npctimer2.txt for example.
        * Added 'detachnpctimer' script command for detaching players from the npc's
          timer. [celest] Syntax:
                 detachnpctimer;
                 detachnpctimer "<NPC Name">;

	* Added 'OnInterIfInitOnce' for WoE scripts & modified the WoE scripts as well [Ajarn & Codemaster] [Thanks to FREYA] [SVN 943]
	* Added the @sound command and the NPC command of soundeffectall
	 - works just like soundeffect, but plays for everyone in the area [Codemaster] [SVN 942]
	* Don't allow Pets to attack Guardians outside of WoE [Codemaster] [SVN 940]
	* Require 15% of HP or more for WE_MALE skill [Codemaster] [SVN 940]
	* Require 15% of SP or more for WE_FEMALE skill [Codemaster] [SVN 940]

01/07
        * Upon changing to high novice 100 stat points should be given, not 88 [celest]
        * Give high novices First Aid and Trick Dead upon job changing [celest]
        * Remove some unnecessary checks in battle.c [celest]
        * Added some checks to prevent novices still allowed to attack when using
          Trick Dead [celest]
        * Added 'summon' script command. Syntax:

          	summon <monster name>,<monster id>[,<event>];

          Example: 'summon "Poring", 1002, "OnPoringKilled"; 'will summon (note:
                   not *spawn*) 1 poring that'll help its master for 1 minute,
                   and activate the "OnPoringKilled" event when killed.
                   'summon "--ja--",-1;' will summon a random monster.

        * Added Wallex's fix for the wedding script functions [celest]
        * Added the below-mentioned alive packet to SQL's char and login [celest]
        * Enabled login server 'anti-freeze' by default as a temporary solution
          to char-login disconnection [celest]
        * The TXT char server was rejecting login's "i'm alive" packet and disconnecting
          it... fixed [celest]
        * Stall_time wasn't being read in login_athena at all (not by the login server,
          because the code didn't read it, nor by TXT map server, since its in the SQL
          inter_athena.conf reading)... so moved it to inter_athena.conf, and
          change sql_config_read in map.c to inter_config_read [celest]
        * Some tidying up of battle_get_def and _def2 [celest]
        * Added 'bDelayrate' and changed Phen card, Marduk Card and Berzebub Card's
          effects to use this instead of bCastrate (which was reducing casting time,
          not delay time) [celest]
        * Some tidying up of skill_castfix and skill_delayfix [celest]
        * Added Filougarou's fix for Bowling Bash causing it to only display damage, 
          but doesn't do any - thanks! [celest]
        * Set delay_dependon_dex in battle_athena to 'no' by default [celest]

          Note: Just to clarify things, on official servers dex is not supposed to 
                reduce skill delays, only Poem of Bragi and Berzebub card does!

        * Fixed typo in skill_delayfix - reduce delays only if delaynodex was *not* set,
          sorry ^^; [celest]

01/06
	* Fixed various memory corruptions causing crashes (SVN 925) [MouseJstr]
	* Fixed typo in src/map/map.c causing compile 
	  errors (SVN 924) [MouseJstr]
	* Removed the alive_timer mechanism entirly replaced with
	  a stall detection mechanism that will disconnect a player
	  who has not sent any data for a configurable 
	  (conf/login_athena.conf:stall_time) amount of time.  The default
	  is currently 60 seconds.

	  The root cause of the disconnect error is that some NAT based
	  routers are not dropping the TCP connection when the aliased
	  machine goes offline abnormally.   This means that we are seeing
	  a stalled but perfectly valid TCP connection.

	  (SVN 924) [MouseJstr]
01/05
	* Fixed some typos in map_versionscreen() [MC Cameri]
	* Removed loop freeing in map-server's do_final(), it was causing seg faults [MC Cameri]
	* Finished do_storage_final() in map-server's do_final(), it was there but doing nothing [MC Cameri]
	* Fixed Celest's typo making all vended items cost 0 zeny [Codemaster] [SVN 919]
        * If a vending item was priced at 0 it'll be auto changed to 1million [celest]
        * Fixed TXT logging - log_athena.conf reading was kind of messed up [celest]
        * Added a simplified version of Qamera's OnConnect: OnDisconnect: OnDeath: 
          NPC events mod, (All credits go to him.) except adapted based on eA's current
          PCLoginEvent. (by davidsiaw) [celest]
          - Currently only 4 events have been added: PCDieEvent, PCKillEvent, 
            PCLogoutEvent and PCLoginEvent
          - For notes and usage example check /npc/sample/PCLoginEvent.txt (by
            davidsiaw)
          - To enable them for a player in a script, do
            "set <name of event>, <0 or 1>;"
            (yes it's saved in a permanent character variable and auto read every time)
          - Simply put, if any of them is set to 1 the appropiate event will activate
          p.s - Scripters who are already using PcLoginEvent, you'll need to add a
                "set PCLoginEvent, 1;" now, sorry for the trouble.

        * Optimised PCLoginEvent activation a bit [celest]
        * Set 'droprate0item''s default to 'yes' so that items with 0 rate will never
          drop [celest]
        * Look at item type other than item ID as well to check whether it is a card
          in card-related script commands - better support for custom items [celest]
        * Reset all skill variables if the skill fails so certain skills can't be
          abused (such as Warp, thanks to Alex14 for pointing it out) [celest]
        * Added /mapflag/noreturn.txt for disabling butterfly wings (not fly wings)
          [celest]
        * Fixed skill_require_db reading somehow getting corrupted if weapons usable
          for the skill is more than 20, thus causing the skills to fail everytime 
          [celest]
        * Fixed @killmonster crashing the server with summoned monsters, thanks to 
          Alex14 [celest]
        * Added double_connection_system to battle_athena (not completed yet) [celest]

01/04
	* Fixed GM Command Logging (Not sure why TXT logging still isn't working properly :( ) [Codemaster] [SVN 907]
	* Fixed one of Lupus' additions to the item_db [Codemaster] [SVN 907]
        * Fixed Seismic Weapon Skill (it 100% didn't break target's weapon at 4 level of the skill) [Lupus]

01/02
        * Re-fixed map-server crashing if an empty line is in skill_castnodex.txt,
          thanks to Alex14 for pointing it out (SVN 899) [celest]
        * Modified breaking rates calculating - meltdown's chances is separated from
          self breaking chances (SVN 900)  [celest]
        * Reduced MAX_SKILL_LEVEL to 10 to save a bit of memory and speed [celest]
        * Tidied up parts in skill_castfix a bit (SVN 895) [celest]
        * Fixed map-server crashing if an empty line was added in any of the skill-xx
          db files  (SVN 895) [celest]
        * Updated skill_castnodex reading - An *optional* 3rd value can be added to set
          whether a skill's delay time can be affected by dex  (SVN 895) [celest]
          Example: 46,1,1 - double strafe's delay is not affected by dex
                   46,1,0:0:0:0:1 - only level 5 double strafe is not affected by dex
	* More atempts at memory leak fixes [Codemaster] [SVN 890]
        * Updated weapon breaking rates, thanks to DracoRPG  (SVN 891) [celest]
        * Optimized enchanting skills success rates calculation, thanks to Wallex
          (you were right! ^^; )  (SVN 891) [celest]
        * Modified Spiral Pierce and Breaker to type ranged (SVN 891) [celest]

01/01/05
	* Attempted to fix a memory leak [Codemaster] - tell me if it works XD (NPC/Mob memory leak in npc_parse_mob(...)) [SVN 886]
	* Added a char config that allows GMs that have a certain level or above to 
	  bypass the server's user limit [Codemaster]
	* Changed some create arrow outputs for new kRO 12/21/04 patch [Aria]
	* Fixed some respawn delays of MVP/Miniboss monsters. Redo Umbala/Niflheim fields, added missing mobs, corrected
	  monsters quantity. In Niflheim fixed wrong Lord of Death monster ID. [Lupus]
12/30
        * Added ispartneron, getpartnerid, and warppartner script
          commands to properly support jawaii NPC's (SVN 880) [MouseJstr]
        * Moved supernovice guardian angel messages to msg_athena.conf [celest]

12/29
	* Fix account register wipe issue (SVN 868) [MouseJstr]
	* Double storage/lag exploit fixed (SVN 867) [MouseJstr]
	* Another -1 alive_timer fix (SVN 866) [MouseJstr]
	* Added @dmstart and @dmtick for debugging malloc tests [MouseJstr]
	* Fix some more compile errors on different platforms [MouseJstr]
	* Fixing a crash if you change the name of a pet you don't have (SVN 863) [MouseJstr]
	* Eliminated src/common/malloc.c when not needed [MouseJstr]
	* Some code cleanup in prep for new debugging malloc (SVN 861) [MouseJstr]
        * Updated Soul Breaker's damage calculation [celest]
        * Updated Meteor Assault's cast delay to be not affected by dex [celest]
        * Changed int_guild.c so it will calculate average guild level only if > 0
          members are found - prevent divide by zero crashes (why would an empty guild
          be requested to update its' member info in the first place?) [celest]
        * Added Shinomori's fixes for string copying in script.c [celest]
	* Removed @giveitem since #item it's the one that does this and added some of it's support to #item [MC Cameri]
	  -#item <item_name> <item_count> <charname|all|everyone>
	* Uncommented out import in charcommand_athena.conf, there is
          need to have it commented (all the others ones are
          uncommented) [Ajarn]

12/28

12/26

		1) update the guild exp, 
		2) update the guild_member exp.

		Note:	mes = otput into client's NPC window
			debugmes = output into map-server window

	  as a FYI, the command I used to create this branch was:

		-Changed guild_skillup functions based on japanese code, but for a good reason.
		  It allows for guild skill trees, sort of. I made Kafra Contract and Guardian Research require Guild Approval, for instance.
		  I think the first four new guild skill requirements are correct, at the least.

	  -Begin your own journey of replacing/removing old printfs, and using the new function.
	  -This function was previously called ShowMessage() in oA, it is now merged, some changes have been done:
		1.Outputting messages to a file is now disabled(commented out).
		2.MSG_SQL is now commented out.
		3.If the server is out of memory, it will not use abort().
		4.Returns 0 if successful, 1 otherwise.
	  -Example: ShowInfo("hello\n"); will print this to the screen: [Info]: hello
	  -Always add \n at the end. Unless someone edits the function to add the \n whether it exists or not.
	  -Just add #include "showmsg.h" wherever you need it.

        * tweaked the auto-configure stuff to deal better with
          machines that have no detectable IP addresses.. is this
          possible?  [MouseJstr]
                src\char_sql\char.c src\char\char.c src\map\map.c
	* Made it compile under gcc 2.95 [MouseJstr]
	* made the char and map servers auto-configure their own IP's
	  whenever possible [MouseJstr]

	  If you do not specify the server IP address, it now determines it
	  on its own.  This means that to get a server running that is
	  accessable from the internet you should only need to specify the
	  location of the data.grf files.  This eliminates one more point
	  of misconfiguration.

	  It does not correctly auto-configure for when you are behind a 
	  router or a firewall since there is no way of determining the 
	  external IP address.  On the other hand, we should be able to 
	  eliminate the lan_conf file since we know our IP addresses as well 
	  as our netmask.
