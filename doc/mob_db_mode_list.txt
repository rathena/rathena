Explanation for modes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Can Move: Enables the mob to move/chase characters.

Looter: The mob will loot up nearby items on the ground when it's on idle state.

Aggressive: normal aggressive mob, will look for a close-by player to attack.

Assist: When a nearby mob of the same class attacks, assist types will join them.

Cast Sensor Idle: Will go after characters who start casting on them if idle
	or walking (without a target).

No Random Walk: The mob will not randomly walk around while in the
	idle state.

No Cast Skill: The mob will be unable to cast skills.

Can Attack: Enables the mob to attack/retaliate when you are within attack
	range. Note that this only enables them to use normal attacks, skills are
	always allowed.

Cast Sensor Chase: Will go after characters who start casting on them if idle
	or chasing other players (they switch chase targets)

Change Chase: Allows chasing mobs to switch targets if another player happens
	to be within attack range (handy on ranged attackers, for example)

Angry: These mobs are "hyper-active". Apart from "chase"/"attack", they have
	the states "follow"/"angry". Once hit, they stop using these states and use
	the normal ones. The new states are used to determine a different skill-set
	for their "before attacked" and "after attacked" states. Also, when
	"following", they automatically switch to whoever character is closest.

Change Target Melee: Enables a mob to switch targets when hit by a normal attack
	while attacking someone else.

Change Target Chase: Enables a mob to switch targets when hit by any attack
	while chasing another character.

Target Weak: Allows aggressive monsters to only be aggressive against 
	characters that are five levels below it's own level.
	For example, a monster of level 104 will not pick fights with a level 99.

Random Target: Picks a new random target in range for each normal attack.

Ignore Melee: The mob will take 1 HP damage from physical attacks.

Ignore Magic: The mob will take 1 HP damage from magic attacks.

Ignore Range: The mob will take 1 HP damage from ranged attacks.

MVP: Flagged as MVP which makes mobs resistant to Coma. Also displays the
	MVP sign and gives players MVP EXP or MVP items.

Ignore Misc: The mob will take 1 HP damage from "none" attack type.

Knockback Immune: The mob will be unable to be knocked back.

Teleport Block: Not implemented yet.

Fixed Item Drop: The mob's drops are not affected by item drop modifiers.

Detector: Enables mob to detect and attack characters who are in hiding/cloak.

Status Immune: Immune to being affected by statuses.

Skill Immune: Immune to being affected by skills.

Aegis Mob Types
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Aegis has are mob-types, where each type represents an AI behavior that

to another:

ABR_OFFENSIVE: 0x00A5 (aggressive, does not walk randomly)

Aegis Class Types
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aegis has different class types that can't be combined but can be reflected by
a combination of rA mode bits.
Add the mode listed here to the mode above.

Aegis/rA
00: 0x0000000 (normal monster)
01: 0x6200000 (boss class, immune to status changes, immune to knockback, detector)
02: 0x4000000 (guardian class, immune to status changes)
04: 0xC000000 (battlefield class, immune to status changes, completely ignores all skills)
05: 0x1000000 (event class, ignores all drop rate adjustments)

- Note that the detector bit for Insect/Demon monsters need to be added
  independently.

Aegis Attr Types
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Aegis attr types are a bitmask just like the rA mode bits and can be 
directly converted. Plant mode is a combination of various of these modes.
Add the mode listed here to the resulting mode above.

Aegis/rA
01: 0x010000 (takes 1 damage from melee attacks)
02: 0x020000 (takes 1 damage from magic attacks)
04: 0x040000 (takes 1 damage from ranged attacks)
08: 0x080000 (MVP, gives MVP rewards, immune to instant death/coma effects)
16: 0x100000 (takes 1 damage from misc attacks)
32: 0x200000 (cannot be knocked back)
64: 0x400000 (teleport block)
