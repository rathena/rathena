Name: Achievement name. Not read into source but used for quick look ups.

---------------------------------------

Target: A list of monster ID and count values that the achievement requires.
		The target count can also be used for achievements that keep a counter while not being related to monster kills.
		Capped at MAX_ACHIEVEMENT_OBJECTIVES.

Example:
  // Player must kill 5 Scorpions and 10 Poring.
  Target:
    - MobID: 1001
      Count: 5
    - MobID: 1002
      Count: 10

Example 2:
  // Player must have 100 or more of ARG0 value. Using the count target value is useful for achievements that are increased in increments
  // and not checked for a total (UI_Type = 1).
  // IE: In the achievement_list.lub file, UI_Type 0 is displayed as non-incremental while 1 shows a progress bar of completion for the achievement.
  Condition: " ARG0 >= 100 "
  Target:
    - Count: 100

---------------------------------------

Condition: A conditional statement that must be met for the achievement to be considered complete. Accepts script constants, player variables, and
		   ARGX (where X is the argument vector value). The ARGX values are sent from the server to the achievement script engine on special events.
		   Below are two examples of how the ARGX feature works.

Example:
	// This function will send 1 argument (ARG0) with a value of i + 1 when a friend is added.
	achievement_update_objective(f_sd, AG_ADD_FRIEND, 1, i + 1);

Example 2:
	// This function will send 2 arguments (ARG0 and ARG1) with values of weapon level and refine level, respectively, when an equipment is
	// successfully refined.
	achievement_update_objective(sd, AG_REFINE_SUCCESS, 2, sd->inventory_data[i]->wlv, sd->inventory.u.items_inventory[i].refine);

---------------------------------------

Map: A map name that is used for the AG_CHATTING type which increments the counter based on the player's map.

---------------------------------------

Dependent: A list of achievement IDs that need to be completed before this achievement is considered complete.

---------------------------------------

Reward: A list of rewards that are given on completion. All fields are optional.
  ItemID: Item ID
  Amount:	Amount of Item ID (default 1)
  Script: Bonus Script
  TitleID: Title ID

---------------------------------------

Score: Achievement points that are given on completion.
