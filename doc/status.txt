EndReturn: List of status that will end if the status activates and it won't give its effect.
           The statuses checked in this list are done at the beginning of status_change_start(). If at least 1 status from this list
		   is removed then it will return back and not check anything else.

---------------------------------------

EndOnEnd: List of status that will end when the status becomes inactive.

---------------------------------------

Notes:

By default, statuses are 'Buff' (those that aren't explicitely given the 'Debuff' flag) which are removable by 'map_quit' in combination with 'battle_config.debuff_on_logout'.

The NoClearbuff flag prevents some permanent and non-permanent statuses that cannot be removed by 'status_change_clear', 'status_change_clear_buffs', 'map_quit', or other
clearing means.
The function 'status_change_clear_buffs' is called by CG_TAROTCARD, RK_REFRESH, RK_LUXANIMA, CG_HERMODE, PA_GOSPEL, and LG_INSPIRATION.

CG_TAROTCARD and CG_HERMODE only remove buffs while PA_GOSPEL and LG_INSPIRATION remove buffs and debuffs.

RK_REFRESH and RK_LUXANIMA only remove statuses that have the Rem_On_Rerfresh or RemoveOnLuxAnima flag. Works just like SA_DISPELL, AB_CLEARANCE, RL_BANISHING_BUSTER that has the
effect to remove buffs or debuffs.
