MinDuration: Minimum duration, in milliseconds, after reduction calculation for status resistance.

---------------------------------------

MinRate: Minimum success rate, at n/10000, after reduction calculation for status resistance.

---------------------------------------

Fail: List of status that causes the status to fail to activate.

---------------------------------------

EndOnStart: List of status that will end if the status activates.

---------------------------------------

EndReturn: List of status that will end if the status activates and it won't give its effect.
           The statuses checked in this list are done at the beginning of status_change_start(). If at least 1 status from this list
		   is removed then it will return back and not check anything else.

---------------------------------------

EndOnEnd: List of status that will end when the status becomes inactive.

Script:	Script to execute, when starting the status change. When this is set all battle relevant status will be recalculated, after
		executing the script. Scripted status changes can only be started on players.

---------------------------------------

Notes:

By default, statuses are 'Buff' (those that aren't explicitely given the 'Debuff' flag) which are removable by 'map_quit' in combination with 'battle_config.debuff_on_logout'.

The NoClearbuff flag prevents some permanent and non-permanent statuses that cannot be removed by 'status_change_clear', 'status_change_clear_buffs', 'map_quit', or other
clearing means.
The function 'status_change_clear_buffs' is called by CG_TAROTCARD, RK_REFRESH, RK_LUXANIMA, CG_HERMODE, PA_GOSPEL, and LG_INSPIRATION.

CG_TAROTCARD and CG_HERMODE only remove buffs while PA_GOSPEL and LG_INSPIRATION remove buffs and debuffs.

RK_REFRESH and RK_LUXANIMA only remove statuses that have the Rem_On_Rerfresh or RemoveOnLuxAnima flag. Works just like SA_DISPELL, AB_CLEARANCE, RL_BANISHING_BUSTER that has the
effect to remove buffs or debuffs.
