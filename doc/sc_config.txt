---------------------------------------

StatusID

Status Change ID.
See src/map/script_constants.hpp for SC_ constants.

---------------------------------------

Icon

Status Icon or client effect that will be displayed client-side.
Default to EFST_BLANK, see src/map/script_constants.hpp for EFST_ constants.

---------------------------------------

DurationLookup

Used for default duration lookup in 'status_sc_get_skill()' based on skill_cast_db.txt,
commonly the lookup is used for some item bonuses as default duration. Example: bonus bAddEff

---------------------------------------

SCS

Specified states given when the SC is active.
Use "|" as delimiter for multiple values.

	SCS_NONE               = (Default) Means nothing.
	SCS_NOMOVE             = Cannot move.
	SCS_NOMOVECOND         = Condition check for SCS_NOMOVE.
	SCS_NOPICKITEM         = Cannot pick item.
	SCS_NOPICKITEMCOND     = Condition check for SCS_NOPICKITEM.
	SCS_NODROPITEM         = Cannot drop item.
	SCS_NODROPITEMCOND     = Condition check for SCS_NODROPITEM.
	SCS_NOCAST             = Cannot cast a skill.
	SCS_NOCASTCOND         = Condition check for SCS_NOCAST.
	SCS_NOCHAT             = Cannot chat and open chat room.
	SCS_NOCHATCOND         = Condition check for SCS_NOCHATCOND.
	SCS_NOEQUIPITEM        = Cannot put on equipment.
	SCS_NOEQUIPITEMCOND    = Condition check for SCS_NOEQUIPITEM.
	SCS_NOUNEQUIPITEM      = Cannot put off equipment.
	SCS_NOUNEQUIPITEMCOND  = Condition check for SCS_NOUNEQUIPITEM.
	SCS_NOCONSUMEITEM      = Cannot consume item.
	SCS_NOCONSUMEITEMCOND  = Condition check for SCS_NOCONSUMEITEM.
	SCS_NOATTACK           = Cannot attack.
	SCS_NOATTACKCOND       = Condition check for SCS_NOATTACK.

Example, if we want to make the player unable to move and unable to cast skills when Berserk/Frenzy is active, the SCS value is:
SCS_NOMOVE|SCS_NOCAST

SCS that have a suffix of "COND" means the SCS has hardcoded conditions in status.c::status_calc_state

---------------------------------------

Running limited-usage-script for active SC.

bonus_script, or sc_start.

---------------------------------------

Notes:

By default, statuses are 'Buff' type, which are removable by 'status_change_clear_buffs' function that is used by
Tarot (CG_TAROTCARD), Refresh (RK_REFESH), Luxanima (RK_LUXANIMA), Wand of Hermode (CG_HERMODE), Gospel
(PA_GOSPEL), and Inspiration (LG_INSPIRATION).

SCF_NO_CLEARBUFF prevents some permanent and non-permanent statuses that cannot be removed by the skills listed above
(doesn't matter if the status is a buff or debuff or the skill that attempts to remove it).

Tarot and Wand of Hermode only remove buffs and not debuffs (except statuses with SCF_DEBUFF).
While Gospel and Inspiration remove buffs and debuffs.

Refresh and Luxanima only remove statuses that have the flag SCF_REM_ON_REFRESH or SCF_REM_ON_LUXANIMA. Works
just like Dispell (SA_DISPELL), Clearance (AB_CLEARANCE), and Banishing Buster (RL_BANISHING_BUSTER) that has
effect to remove buffs or debuffs.
